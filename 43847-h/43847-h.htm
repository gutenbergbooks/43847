<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>The Prophets, to whom this and a following volume
are dedicated, have, to our loss, been haunted
for centuries by a peddling and an ambiguous title.
Their Twelve Books are in size smaller than those of
the great Three which precede them, and doubtless
none of their chapters soar so high as the brilliant
summits to which we are swept by Isaiah and the
Prophet of the Exile. But in every other respect they
are undeserving of the niggardly name of "Minor."
Two of them, Amos and Hosea, were the first of
all prophecy&mdash;rising cliff-like, with a sheer and
magnificent originality, to a height and a mass
sufficient to set after them the trend and slope of the
whole prophetic range. The Twelve together cover
the extent of that range, and illustrate the development
of prophecy at almost every stage from the eighth century
to the fourth. Yet even more than in the case of
Isaiah or Jeremiah, the Church has been content to use
a passage here and a passage there, leaving the rest
of the books to absolute neglect or the almost equal
oblivion of routine-reading. Among the causes of this
disuse have been the more than usually corrupt state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
of the text; the consequent disorder and in parts
unintelligibleness of all the versions; the ignorance
of the various historical circumstances out of which
the books arose; the absence of successful efforts to
determine the periods and strophes, the dramatic
dialogues (with the names of the speakers), the lyric
effusions and the passages of argument, of all of which
the books are composed.</p>

<p>The following exposition is an attempt to assist the
bettering of all this. As the Twelve Prophets illustrate
among them the whole history of written prophecy, I
have thought it useful to prefix a historical sketch of
the Prophet in early Israel, or as far as the appearance
of Amos. The Twelve are then taken in chronological
order. Under each of them a chapter is given of
historical and critical introduction to his book; then
some account of the prophet himself as a man and
a seer; then a complete translation of the various
prophecies handed down under his name, with textual
footnotes, and an exposition and application to the
present day in harmony with the aim of the series to
which these volumes belong; finally, a discussion of
the main doctrines the prophet has taught, if it has
not been found possible to deal with these in the course
of the exposition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An exact critical study of the Twelve Prophets is
rendered necessary by the state of the entire text.
The present volume is based on a thorough examination
of this in the light of the ancient versions and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
modern criticism. The emendations which I have
proposed are few and insignificant, but I have
examined and discussed in footnotes all that have been
suggested, and in many cases my translation will be
found to differ widely from that of the Revised Version.
To questions of integrity and authenticity more space
is devoted than may seem to many to be necessary.
But it is certain that the criticism of the prophetic books
has now entered on a period of the same analysis and
discrimination which is almost exhausted in the case of
the Pentateuch. Some hints were given of this in a
previous volume on Isaiah, chapters xl.-lxvi., which
are evidently a composite work. Among the books now
before us, the same fact has long been clear in the case
of Obadiah and Zechariah, and also since Ewald's time
with regard to Micah. But Duhm's <i>Theology of the
Prophets</i>, which appeared in 1875, suggested interpolations
in Amos. Wellhausen (in 1873) and Stade (from
1883 onwards) carried the discussion further both on
those, and others, of the Twelve; while a recent work
by Andrée on Haggai proves that many similar
questions may still be raised and have to be debated.
The general fact must be admitted that hardly one book
has escaped later additions&mdash;additions of an entirely
justifiable nature, which supplement the point of view
of a single prophet with the richer experience or the
riper hopes of a later day, and thus afford to ourselves
a more catholic presentment of the doctrines of
prophecy and the Divine purposes for mankind. This
general fact, I say, must be admitted. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
questions of detail are still in process of solution.
It is obvious that settled results can be reached (as
to some extent they have been already reached in the
criticism of the Pentateuch) only after years of research
and debate by all schools of critics. Meantime
it is the duty of each of us to offer his own conclusions,
with regard to every separate passage, on the understanding
that, however final they may at present seem
to him, the end is not yet. In previous criticism
the defects, of which work in the same field has
made me aware, are four: 1. A too rigid belief in
the exact parallelism and symmetry of the prophetic
style, which I feel has led, for instance, Wellhausen,
to whom we otherwise owe so much on the Twelve
Prophets, into many unnecessary emendations of the
text, or, where some amendment is necessary, to
absolutely unprovable changes. 2. In passages between
which no connection exists, the forgetfulness
of the principle that this fact may often be explained
as justly by the hypothesis of the omission of some
words, as by the favourite theory of the later intrusion
of portions of the extant text. 3. Forgetfulness of the
possibility, which in some cases amounts almost to
certainty, of the incorporation, among the authentic
words of a prophet, of passages of earlier as well as
of later date. And, 4. depreciation of the spiritual
insight and foresight of pre-exilic writers. These, I
am persuaded, are defects in previous criticism of the
prophets. Probably my own criticism will reveal many
more. In the beginnings of such analysis as we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
engaged on, we must be prepared for not a little arbitrariness
and want of proportion; these are often necessary for
insight and fresh points of view, but they are as easily eliminated
by the progress of discussion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All criticism, however, is preliminary to the real work
which the immortal prophets demand from scholars and
preachers in our age. In a review of a previous volume,
I was blamed for applying a prophecy of Isaiah to a problem
of our own day. This was called "prostituting prophecy."
<i>The</i> prostitution of the prophets is their confinement to
academic uses. One cannot conceive an ending, at once
more pathetic and more ridiculous, to those great streams
of living water, than to allow them to run out in the sands
of criticism and exegesis, however golden these sands may be.
The prophets spoke for a practical purpose; they aimed at
the hearts of men; and everything that scholarship can do
for their writings has surely for its final aim the illustration of
their witness to the ways of God with men, and its application
to living questions and duties and hopes. Besides,
therefore, seeking to tell the story of that wonderful stage
in the history of the human spirit&mdash;surely next in wonder
to the story of Christ Himself&mdash;I have not feared at every
suitable point to apply its truths to our lives to-day. The
civilisation in which prophecy flourished was in its essentials
marvellously like our own. To mark only one point, the
rise of prophecy in Israel came fast upon the passage of the
nation from an agricultural to a commercial basis of society,
and upon the appearance of the very thing which gives its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
name to civilisation&mdash;city-life, with its unchanging sins,
problems and ideals.</p>

<p>A recent Dutch critic, whose exact scholarship is known
to all readers of Stade's <i>Journal of Old Testament Science</i>,
has said of Amos and Hosea: "These prophecies have a word
of God, as for all times, so also especially for our own.
Before all it is relevant to 'the social question' of our day,
to the relation of religion and morality.... Often it has
been hard for me to refrain from expressly pointing out the
agreement between Then and To-day."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This feeling
will be shared by all students of prophecy whose minds and
consciences are quick; and I welcome the liberal plan of the
series in which this volume appears, because, while giving
room for the adequate discussion of critical and historical
questions, its chief design is to show the eternal validity of
the Books of the Bible as the Word of God, and their
meaning for ourselves to-day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Previous works on the Minor Prophets are almost innumerable.
Those to which I owe most will be found
indicated in the footnotes. The translation has been executed
upon the purpose, not to sacrifice the literal meaning
or exact emphasis of the original to the frequent possibility
of greater elegance. It reproduces every word, with the
occasional exception of a copula. With some hesitation
I have retained the traditional spelling of the Divine Name,
Jehovah, instead of the more correct Jahve or Yahweh; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
where the rhythm of certain familiar passages was disturbed
by it, I have followed the English versions and written
Lord. The reader will keep in mind that a line may be
destroyed by substituting our pronunciation of proper names
for the more musical accents of the original. Thus, for
instance, we obliterate the music of "Isra'el" by making it
two syllables and putting the accent on the first: it has three
syllables with the accent on the last. We crush Yerushalayî&#7743;
into Jerúsalem; we shred off Asshûr into Assyria, and dub
Mi&#7779;raî&#7743; Egypt. Hebrew has too few of the combinations
which sound most musical to our ears, to afford the suppression
of any one of them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE BOOK OF THE TWELVE</i></h3>


<p>In the order of our English Bible the Minor Prophets,
as they are usually called, form the last
twelve books of the Old Testament. They are immediately
preceded by Daniel, and before him by the three
Major Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah (with Lamentations)
and Ezekiel. Why all sixteen were thus gathered
at the end of the other sacred books, we do not know.
Perhaps, because it was held fitting that prophecy should
occupy the last outposts of the Old Testament towards
the New.</p>

<p>In the Hebrew Bible, however, the order differs, and
is much more significant. The Prophets<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> form the
second division of the threefold Canon: Law, Prophets
and Writings; and Daniel is not among them. The
Minor follow immediately after Ezekiel. Moreover,
they are not twelve books, but one. They are
gathered under the common title <i>Book of the Twelve</i>;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and although each of them has the usual colophon
detailing the number of its own verses, there is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
one colophon for all the twelve, placed at the end of
Malachi and reckoning the sum of their verses from
the first of Hosea onwards. This unity, which there
is reason to suppose was given to them before their
reception into the Canon,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> they have never since
lost. However much their place has changed in the
order of the books of the Old Testament, however
much their own internal arrangement has differed,
the Twelve have always stood together. There has
been every temptation to scatter them because of their
various dates. Yet they never have been scattered; and
in spite of the fact that they have not preserved their
common title in any Bible outside the Hebrew, that title
has lived on in literature and common talk. Thus the
Greek canon omits it; but Greek Jews and Christians
always counted the books as one volume,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> calling them
"The Twelve Prophets," or "The Twelve-Prophet"
Book.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. It was the Latins who designated them "The
Minor Prophets": "on account of their brevity as compared
with those who are called the Major because of
their ampler volumes."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> And this name has passed
into most modern languages,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> including our own. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
surely it is better to revert to the original, canonical
and unambiguous title of "The Twelve."</p>

<p>The collection and arrangement of "The Twelve"
are matters of obscurity, from which, however, three
or four facts emerge that are tolerably certain. The
inseparableness of the books is a proof of the ancient
date of their union. They must have been put together
before they were received into the Canon. The Canon
of the Prophets&mdash;Joshua to Second Kings and Isaiah
to Malachi&mdash;was closed by 200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> at the latest, and
perhaps as early as 250; but if we have (as seems
probable) portions of "The Twelve,"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> which must be
assigned to a little later than 300, this may be held
to prove that the whole collection cannot have long
preceded the fixing of the Canon of the Prophets. On
the other hand, the fact that these latest pieces have
not been placed under a title of their own, but are
attached to the Book of Zechariah, is pretty sufficient
evidence that they were added after the collection and
fixture of twelve books&mdash;a round number which there
would be every disposition not to disturb. That would
give us for the date of the first edition (so to speak) of
our Twelve some year before 300; and for the date
of the second edition some year towards 250. This is
a question, however, which may be reserved for final
decision after we have examined the date of the separate
books, and especially of Joel and the second half of
Zechariah. That there was a previous collection, as
early as the Exile, of the books written before then, may
be regarded as more than probable. But we have no
means of fixing its exact limits. Why the Twelve were
all ultimately put together is reasonably suggested by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Jewish writers. They are small, and, as separate rolls,
might have been lost.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It is possible that the desire
of the round number twelve is responsible for the
admission of Jonah, a book very different in form
from all the others; just as we have hinted that the
fact of there being already twelve may account for the
attachment of the late fragments to the Book of Zechariah.
But all this is only to guess, where we have no means
of certain knowledge.</p>

<p>"The Book of the Twelve" has not always held the
place which it now occupies in the Hebrew Canon, at
the end of the Prophets. The rabbis taught that
Hosea, but for the comparative smallness of his prophecy,
should have stood first of all the writing prophets,
of whom they regarded him as the oldest.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> And
doubtless it was for the same chronological reasons,
that early Christian catalogues of the Scriptures, and
various editions of the Septuagint, placed the whole of
"The Twelve" in front of Isaiah.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The internal arrangement of "The Twelve" in our
English Bible is the same as that of the Hebrew Canon,
and was probably determined by what the compilers
thought to be the respective ages of the books. Thus,
first we have six, all supposed to be of the earlier
Assyrian period, before 700&mdash;Hosea, Joel, Amos,
Obadiah, Jonah and Micah; then three from the
late Assyrian and the Babylonian periods&mdash;Nahum,
Habbakuk and Zephaniah; and then three from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Persian period after the Exile&mdash;Haggai, Zechariah and
Malachi. The Septuagint have altered the order of
the first six, arranging Hosea, Amos, Micah, Joel and
Obadiah according to their size, and setting Jonah after
them, probably because of his different form. The
remaining six are left as in the Hebrew.</p>

<p>Recent criticism, however, has made it clear that the
Biblical order of "The Twelve Prophets" is no more
than a very rough approximation to the order of their
real dates; and, as it is obviously best for us to follow
in their historical succession prophecies, which illustrate
the whole history of prophecy from its rise with Amos
to its fall with Malachi and his successors, I propose to
do this. Detailed proofs of the separate dates must be
left to each book. All that is needful here is a general
statement of the order.</p>

<p>Of the first six prophets the dates of Amos, Hosea,
and Micah (but of the latter's book in part only) are
certain. The Jews have been able to defend Hosea's
priority only on fanciful grounds.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Whether or not he
quotes from Amos, his historical allusions are more
recent. With the exception of a few fragments incorporated
by later authors, the Book of Amos is thus the
earliest example of prophetic literature, and we take it
first. The date we shall see is about 755. Hosea
begins five or ten years later, and Micah just before 722.
The three are in every respect&mdash;originality, comprehensiveness,
influence upon other prophets&mdash;the greatest of
our Twelve, and will therefore be treated with most
detail, occupying the whole of the first volume.</p>

<p>The rest of the first six are Obadiah, Joel and Jonah.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
But the Book of Obadiah, although it opens with an
early oracle against Edom, is in its present form from
after the Exile. The Book of Joel is of uncertain date,
but, as we shall see, the great probability is that it is
late; and the Book of Jonah belongs to a form of
literature so different from the others that we may,
most conveniently, treat of it last.</p>

<p>This leaves us to follow Micah, at the end of the
eighth century, with the group Zephaniah, Nahum and
Habakkuk from the second half of the seventh century;
and finally to take in their order the post-exilic Haggai,
Zechariah i.-ix., Malachi, and the other writings which
we feel obliged to place about or even after that date.</p>

<p>One other word is needful. This assignment of
the various books to different dates is not to be held
as implying that the whole of a book belongs to such
a date or to the author whose name it bears. We
shall find that hands have been busy with the texts
of the books long after the authors of these must have
passed away; that besides early fragments incorporated
by later writers, prophets of Israel's new dawn mitigated
the judgments and lightened the gloom of the
watchmen of her night; that here and there are passages
which are evidently intrusions, both because they interrupt
the argument and because they reflect a much
later historical environment than their context. This,
of course, will require discussion in each case, and
such discussion will be given. The text will be subjected
to an independent examination. Some passages
hitherto questioned we may find to be unjustly so;
others not hitherto questioned we may see reason to
suspect. But in any case we shall keep in mind, that
the results of an independent inquiry are uncertain;
and that in this new criticism of the prophets, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
is comparatively recent, we cannot hope to arrive
for some time at so general a consensus, as is being
rapidly reached in the far older and more elaborated
criticism of the Pentateuch.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such is the extent and order of the journey which
lies before us. If it is not to the very summits of
Israel's outlook that we climb&mdash;Isaiah, Jeremiah and
the great Prophet of the Exile&mdash;we are yet to traverse
the range of prophecy from beginning to end. We
start with its first abrupt elevations in Amos. We are
carried by the side of Isaiah and Jeremiah, yet at a
lower altitude, on to the Exile. With the returned
Israel we pursue an almost immediate rise to vision, and
then by Malachi and others are conveyed down dwindling
slopes to the very end. Beyond the land is flat.
Though Psalms are sung and brave deeds done, and
faith is strong and bright, there is no height of outlook;
<i>there is no more any prophet</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> in Israel.</p>

<p>But our "Twelve" do more than thus carry us from
beginning to end of the Prophetic Period. Of second
rank as are most of the heights of this mountain range,
they yet bring forth and speed on their way not a few
of the streams of living water which have nourished
later ages, and are flowing to-day. Impetuous cataracts
of righteousness&mdash;<i>let it roll on like water, and justice as
an everlasting stream</i>; the irrepressible love of God to
sinful men; the perseverance and pursuits of His
grace; His mercies that follow the exile and the
outcast; His truth that goes forth richly upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
heathen; the hope of the Saviour of mankind; the outpouring
of the Spirit; counsels of patience; impulses
of tenderness and of healing; melodies innumerable,&mdash;all
sprang from these lower hills of prophecy, and
sprang so strongly that the world hears and feels them
still.</p>

<p>And from the heights of our present pilgrimage there
are also clear those great visions of the Stars and the
Dawn, of the Sea and the Storm, concerning which it
is true, that as long as men live they shall seek out the
places whence they can be seen, and thank God for
His prophets.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE PROPHET IN EARLY ISRAEL</i></h3>


<p>Our "Twelve Prophets" will carry us, as we have
seen, across the whole extent of the Prophetical
period&mdash;the period when prophecy became literature,
assuming the form and rising to the intensity of an
imperishable influence on the world. The earliest
of the Twelve, Amos and Hosea, were the inaugurators
of this period. They were not only the first
(so far as we know) to commit prophecy to writing,
but we find in them the germs of all its subsequent
development. Yet Amos and Hosea were not
unfathered. Behind them lay an older dispensation,
and their own was partly a product of this, and
partly a revolt against it. Amos says of himself: <i>The
Lord hath spoken, who can but prophesy?</i>&mdash;but again:
<i>No prophet I, nor prophet's son</i>! Who were those
earlier prophets, whose office Amos assumed while
repudiating their spirit&mdash;whose name he abjured, yet
could not escape from it? And, while we are about
the matter, what do we mean by "prophet" in general?</p>

<p>In vulgar use the name "prophet" has degenerated
to the meaning of "one who foretells the future." Of
this meaning it is, perhaps, the first duty of every
student of prophecy earnestly and stubbornly to rid
himself. In its native Greek tongue "prophet" meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
not "one who speaks before," but "one who speaks
for, or on behalf of, another." At the Delphic
oracle "The Proph&#275;t&#275;s" was the title of the official,
who received the utterances of the frenzied Pythoness
and expounded them to the people;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> but Plato says
that this is a misuse of the word, and that the true
prophet is the inspired person himself, he who is in
communication with the Deity and who speaks directly
for the Deity.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> So Tiresias, the seer, is called by
Pindar the "prophet" or "interpreter of Zeus,"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and
Plato even styles poets "the prophets of the Muses."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
It is in this sense that we must think of the "prophet"
of the Old Testament. He is a speaker for
God. The sharer of God's counsels, as Amos calls
him, he becomes the bearer and preacher of God's
Word. Prediction of the future is only a part, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
often a subordinate and accidental part, of an office
whose full function is to declare the character and
the will of God. But the prophet does this in no
systematic or abstract form. He brings his revelation
point by point, and in connection with some occasion
in the history of his people, or some phase of their
character. He is not a philosopher nor a theologian with
a system of doctrine (at least before Ezekiel), but the
messenger and herald of God at some crisis in the life
or conduct of His people. His message is never out
of touch with events. These form either the subject-matter
or the proof or the execution of every oracle
he utters. It is, therefore, God not merely as Truth,
but far more as Providence, whom the prophet reveals.
And although that Providence includes the full destiny
of Israel and mankind, the prophet brings the news of
it, for the most part, piece by piece, with reference to
some present sin or duty, or some impending crisis or
calamity. Yet he does all this, not merely because the
word needed for the day has been committed to him
by itself, and as if he were only its mechanical vehicle;
but because he has come under the overwhelming
conviction of God's presence and of His character, a
conviction often so strong that God's word breaks
through him and God speaks in the first person to the
people.</p>


<h4>1. <span class="smcap">From the Earliest Times till Samuel.</span></h4>

<p>There was no ancient people but believed in the
power of certain personages to consult the Deity and
to reveal His will. Every man could sacrifice; but
not every man could render in return the oracle of
God. This pertained to select individuals or orders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
So the prophet seems to have been an older specialist
than the priest, though in every tribe he frequently
combined the latter's functions with his own.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The matters on which ancient man consulted God
were as wide as life. But naturally at first, in a rude
state of society and at a low stage of mental development,
it was in regard to the material defence and
necessities of life, the bare law and order, that men
almost exclusively sought the Divine will. And the
whole history of prophecy is just the effort to substitute
for these elementary provisions a more personal
standard of the moral law, and more spiritual ideals
of the Divine Grace.</p>

<p>By the Semitic race&mdash;to which we may now confine
ourselves, since Israel belonged to it&mdash;Deity was
worshipped, in the main, as the god of a tribe. Every
Semitic tribe had its own god; it would appear that
there was no god without a tribe:<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> the traces of
belief in a supreme and abstract Deity are few and
ineffectual. The tribe was the medium by which the
god made himself known, and became an effective
power on earth: the god was the patron of the tribe, the
supreme magistrate and the leader in war. The piety
he demanded was little more than loyalty to ritual; the
morality he enforced was only a matter of police. He
took no cognisance of the character or inner thoughts
of the individual. But the tribe believed him to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
in very close connection with all the practical interests
of their common life. They asked of him the detection
of criminals, the discovery of lost property, the settlement
of civil suits, sometimes when the crops should
be sown, and always when war should be waged and
by what tactics.</p>

<p>The means by which the prophet consulted the Deity
on these subjects were for the most part primitive
and rude. They may be summed up under two kinds:
Visions either through falling into ecstasy or by
dreaming in sleep, and Signs or Omens. Both kinds
are instanced in Balaam.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Of the signs some were
natural, like the whisper of trees, the flight of birds,
the passage of clouds, the movements of stars. Others
were artificial, like the casting or drawing of lots.
Others were between these, like the shape assumed
by the entrails of the sacrificed animals when thrown
on the ground. Again, the prophet was often obliged
to do something wonderful in the people's sight, in
order to convince them of his authority. In Biblical
language he had to work a miracle or give a sign.
One instance throws a flood of light on this habitual
expectancy of the Semitic mind. There was once an
Arab chief, who wished to consult a distant soothsayer
as to the guilt of a daughter. But before he would
trust the seer to give him the right answer to such
a question, he made him discover a grain of corn
which he had concealed about his horse.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> He required
the physical sign before he would accept the moral
judgment.</p>

<p>Now, to us the crudeness of the means employed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the opportunities of fraud, the inadequacy of the tests
for spiritual ends, are very obvious. But do not let us,
therefore, miss the numerous moral opportunities which
lay before the prophet even at that early stage of his
evolution. He was trusted to speak in the name of
Deity. Through him men believed in God and in the
possibility of a revelation. They sought from him the
discrimination of evil from good. The highest possibilities
of social ministry lay open to him: the tribal
existence often hung on his word for peace or war;
he was the mouth of justice, the rebuke of evil, the
champion of the wronged. Where such opportunities
were present, can we imagine the Spirit of God to have
been absent&mdash;the Spirit Who seeks men more than
they seek Him, and as He condescends to use their poor
language for religion must also have stooped to the
picture language, to the rude instruments, symbols
and sacraments, of their early faith?</p>

<p>In an office of such mingled possibilities everything
depended&mdash;as we shall find it depend to the very end
of prophecy&mdash;on the moral insight and character of the
prophet himself, on his conception of God and whether
he was so true to this as to overcome his professional
temptations to fraud and avarice, malice towards
individuals, subservience to the powerful, or, worst
snares of all, the slothfulness and insincerity of routine.
We see this moral issue put very clearly in such a
story as that of Balaam, or in such a career as that of
Mohammed.</p>

<p>So much for the Semitic soothsayer in general. Now
let us turn to Israel.</p>

<p>Among the Hebrews the <i>man of God</i>,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
his widest designation, is at first called <i>Seer</i>,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> or
<i>Gazer</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the word which Balaam uses of himself.
In consulting the Divine will he employs the same
external means, he offers the people for their evidence
the same signs, as do the seers or soothsayers of other
Semitic tribes. He gains influence by the miracles,
<i>the wonderful things</i>, which he does.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Moses himself is
represented after this fashion. He meets the magicians
of Egypt on their own level. His use of <i>rods</i>; the
holding up of his hands that Israel may prevail against
Amaleq; Joshua's casting of lots to discover a criminal;
Samuel's dream in the sanctuary; his discovery for a
fee of the lost asses of Saul; David and the images in his
house, the ephod he consulted; the sign to go to battle
<i>what time thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of
the mulberry trees</i>; Solomon's inducement of dreams by
sleeping in the sanctuary at Gibeah,&mdash;these are a few of
the many proofs, that early prophecy in Israel employed
not only the methods but even much of the furniture of
the kindred Semitic religions. But then those tools
and methods were at the same time accompanied by
the noble opportunities of the prophetic office to which
I have just alluded&mdash;opportunities of religious and
social ministry&mdash;and, still more, these opportunities
were at the disposal of moral influences which, it is a
matter of history, were not found in any other Semitic
religion than Israel's. However you will explain
it, that Divine Spirit, which we have felt unable to
conceive as absent from any Semitic prophet who
truly sought after God, that Light which lighteth
every man who cometh into the world, was present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to an unparalleled degree with the early prophets of
Israel. He came to individuals, and to the nation as
a whole, in events and in influences which may be
summed up as the impression of the character of their
national God, Jehovah: to use Biblical language, as
<i>Jehovah's spirit</i> and <i>power</i>. It is true that in many
ways the Jehovah of early Israel reminds us of other
Semitic deities. Like some of them He appears with
thunder and lightning; like all of them He is the God
of one tribe who are His peculiar people. He bears
the same titles&mdash;Melek, Adon, Baal (<i>King</i>, <i>Lord</i>,
<i>Possessor</i>). He is propitiated by the same offerings.
To choose one striking instance, captives and spoil of
war are sacrificed to Him with the same relentlessness,
and by a process which has even the same names given
to it, as in the votive inscriptions of Israel's heathen
neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Yet, notwithstanding all these elements,
the religion of Jehovah from the very first evinced, by
the confession of all critics, an ethical force shared by
no other Semitic creed. From the first there was in it
the promise and the potency of that sublime monotheism,
which in the period of our "Twelve" it afterwards
reached.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Its earliest effects of course were chiefly
political: it welded the twelve tribes into the unity of a
nation; it preserved them as one amid the many temptations
to scatter along those divergent lines of culture
and of faith, which the geography of their country
placed so attractively before them.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> It taught them to
prefer religious loyalty to material advantage, and so
inspired them with high motives for self-sacrifice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
every other duty of patriotism. But it did even better
than thus teach them to bear one another's burdens.
It inspired them to care for one another's sins. The
last chapters of the Book of Judges prove how strong
a national conscience there was in early Israel. Even
then Israel was a moral, as well as a political, unity.
Gradually there grew up, but still unwritten, a body
of Torah, or revealed law, which, though its framework
was the common custom of the Semitic race, was
inspired by ideals of humanity and justice not elsewhere
in that race discernible by us.</p>

<p>When we analyse this ethical distinction of early
Israel, this indubitable progress which the nation were
making while the rest of their world was morally
stagnant, we find it to be due to their impressions
of the character of their God. This character did not
affect them as Righteousness only. At first it was even a
more wonderful Grace. Jehovah had chosen them when
they were no people, had redeemed them from servitude,
had brought them to their land; had borne with their
stubbornness, and had forgiven their infidelities. Such
a Character was partly manifest in the great events of
their history, and partly communicated itself to their
finest personalities&mdash;as the Spirit of God does communicate
with the spirit of man made in His image.
Those personalities were the early prophets from Moses
to Samuel. They inspired the nation to believe in God's
purposes for itself; they rallied it to war for the common
faith, and war was then the pitch of self-sacrifice;
they gave justice to it in God's name, and rebuked its
sinfulness without sparing. Criticism has proved that
we do not know nearly so much about those first
prophets, as perhaps we thought we did. But under
their God they made Israel. Out of their work grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the monotheism of their successors, whom we are
now to study, and later the Christianity of the New
Testament. For myself I cannot but believe, that in
the influence of Jehovah which Israel owned in those
early times, there was the authentic revelation of a
real Being.</p>


<h4>2. <span class="smcap">From Samuel to Elisha.</span></h4>

<p>Of the oldest order of Hebrew prophecy, Samuel
was the last representative. Till his time, we are told,
the prophet in Israel was known as the Seer,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> but
now, with other tempers and other habits, a new order
appears, whose name&mdash;and that means to a certain
extent their spirit&mdash;is to displace the older name and
the older spirit.</p>

<p>When Samuel anointed Saul he bade him, for a sign
that he was chosen of the Lord, go forth to meet <i>a
company of prophets</i>&mdash;Nebi'îm, the singular is Nabi'&mdash;coming
down from the high place or sanctuary with
viols, drums and pipes, and <i>prophesying</i>. <i>There</i>, he
added, <i>the spirit of Jehovah shall come upon thee, and
thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into
another man</i>. So it happened; and the people <i>said one
to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish?
Is Saul also among the prophets?</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Another story,
probably from another source, tells us that later, when
Saul sent troops of messengers to the sanctuary at
Ramah to take David, they saw <i>the company of prophets
prophesying and Samuel standing appointed over them,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
<i>and the spirit of God fell</i> upon one after another of the
troops; as upon Saul himself when he followed them
up. <i>And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied
before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that
day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also
among the prophets?</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>All this is very different from the habits of the
Seer, who had hitherto represented prophecy. He
was solitary, but these went about in bands. They
were filled with an infectious enthusiasm, by which
they excited each other and all sensitive persons whom
they touched. They stirred up this enthusiasm by
singing, playing upon instruments, and dancing: its
results were frenzy, the tearing of their clothes, and
prostration. The same phenomena have appeared in
every religion&mdash;in Paganism often, and several times
within Christianity. They may be watched to-day
among the dervishes of Islam, who by singing (as
one has seen them in Cairo), by swaying of their
bodies, by repeating the Divine Name, and dwelling
on the love and ineffable power of God, work themselves
into an excitement which ends in prostration
and often in insensibility.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The whole process is due to
an overpowering sense of the Deity&mdash;crude and unintelligent
if you will, but sincere and authentic&mdash;which
seems to haunt the early stages of all religions, and to
linger to the end with the stagnant and unprogressive.
The appearance of this prophecy in Israel has given
rise to a controversy as to whether it was purely a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
native product, or was induced by infection from the
Canaanite tribes around. Such questions are of little
interest in face of these facts: that the ecstasy sprang
up in Israel at a time when the spirit of the people was
stirred against the Philistines, and patriotism and religion
were equally excited; that it is represented as due to
the Spirit of Jehovah; and that the last of the old order
of Jehovah's prophets recognised its harmony with his
own dispensation, presided over it, and gave Israel's
first king as one of his signs, that he should come under
its power. These things being so, it is surprising that a
recent critic<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> should have seen in the dancing prophets
nothing but eccentrics into whose company it was
shame for so good a man as Saul to fall. He reaches
this conclusion only by supposing that the reflexive
verb used for their <i>prophesying</i>&mdash;<i>hithnabb&#275;'</i>&mdash;had at this
time that equivalence to mere madness to which it
was reduced by the excesses of later generations of
prophets. With Samuel we feel that the word had
no reproach: the Nebi'îm were recognised by him as
standing in the prophetical succession. They sprang
up in sympathy with a national movement. The king
who joined himself to them was the same who sternly
banished from Israel all the baser forms of soothsaying
and traffic with the dead. But, indeed, we need no
other proof than this: the name Nebi'îm so establishes
itself in the popular regard that it displaces the older
names of Seer and Gazer, and becomes the classical
term for the whole body of prophets from Moses to
Malachi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>There was one very remarkable change effected by
this new order of prophets, probably the very greatest
relief which prophecy experienced in the course of its
evolution. This was separation from the ritual and
from the implements of soothsaying. Samuel had been
both priest and prophet. But after him the names and
the duties were specialised, though the specialising was
incomplete. While the new Nebi'îm remained in connection
with the ancient centres of religion, they do not
appear to have exercised any part of the ritual. The
priests, on the other hand, did not confine themselves
to sacrifice and other forms of public worship, but
exercised many of the so-called prophetic functions.
They also, as Hosea tells us, were expected to give
Tôrôth&mdash;revelations of the Divine will on points of
conduct and order. There remained with them the
ancient forms of oracle&mdash;the Ephod, or plated image,
the Teraphim, the lot, and the Urim and Thummim,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
all of these apparently still regarded as indispensable
elements of religion.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> From such rude forms of ascertaining
the Divine Will, prophecy in its new order was
absolutely free. And it was free of the ritual of the
sanctuaries. As has been justly remarked, the ritual of
Israel always remained a peril to the people, the peril
of relapsing into Paganism. Not only did it materialise
faith and engross affections in the worshipper which
were meant for moral objects, but very many of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
forms were actually the same as those of the other
Semitic religions, and it tempted its devotees to the
confusion of their God with the gods of the heathen.
Prophecy was now wholly independent of it, and we
may see in such independence the possibility of all the
subsequent career of prophecy along moral and spiritual
lines. Amos absolutely condemns the ritual, and Hosea
brings the message from God, <i>I will have mercy and not
sacrifice</i>. This is the distinctive glory of prophecy in
that era in which we are to study it. But do not let
us forget that it became possible through the ecstatic
Nebi'îm of Samuel's time, and through their separation
from the national ritual and the material forms of
soothsaying. It is the way of Providence to prepare
for the revelation of great moral truths, by the enfranchisement,
sometimes centuries before, of an order
or a nation of men from political or professional
interests which would have rendered it impossible for
their descendants to appreciate those truths without
prejudice or compromise.</p>

<p>We may conceive then of these Nebi'îm, these
prophets, as enthusiasts for Jehovah and for Israel.
For Jehovah&mdash;if to-day we see men cast by the adoration
of the despot-deity of Islam into transports so
excessive that they lose all consciousness of earthly
things and fall into a trance, can we not imagine a like
effect produced on the same sensitive natures of the
East by the contemplation of such a God as Jehovah,
so mighty in earth and heaven, so faithful to His people,
so full of grace? Was not such an ecstasy of worship
most likely to be born of the individual's ardent devotion
in the hour of the nation's despair?<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Of course there
would be swept up by such a movement all the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
volatile and unbalanced minds of the day&mdash;as these
always have been swept up by any powerful religious
excitement&mdash;but that is not to discredit the sincerity
of the main volume of the feeling nor its authenticity
as a work of the Spirit of God, as the impression of
the character and power of Jehovah.</p>

<p>But these ecstatics were also enthusiasts for Israel;
and this saved the movement from morbidness. They
worshipped God neither out of sheer physical sympathy
with nature, like the Ph&#339;nician devotees of
Adonis or the Greek Bacchantes; nor out of terror
at the approaching end of all things, like some of
the ecstatic sects of the Middle Ages; nor out of a
selfish passion for their own salvation, like so many
a modern Christian fanatic; but in sympathy with their
nation's aspirations for freedom and her whole political
life. They were enthusiasts for their people. The
ecstatic prophet was not confined to his body nor to
nature for the impulses of Deity. Israel was his body,
his atmosphere, his universe. Through it all he felt
the thrill of Deity. Confine religion to the personal,
it grows rancid, morbid. Wed it to patriotism, it lives
in the open air and its blood is pure. So in days of
national danger the Nebi'îm would be inspired like
Saul to battle for their country's freedom; in more
settled times they would be lifted to the responsibilities
of educating the people, counselling the governors, and
preserving the national traditions. This is what actually
took place. After the critical period of Saul's time has
passed, the prophets still remain enthusiasts; but they
are enthusiasts for affairs. They counsel and they
rebuke David.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> They warn Rehoboam, and they excite
Northern Israel to revolt.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> They overthrow and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
set up dynasties.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> They offer the king advice on campaigns.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Like Elijah, they take up against the throne
the cause of the oppressed;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> like Elisha, they stand by
the throne its most trusted counsellors in peace and war.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
That all this is no new order of prophecy in Israel,
but the developed form of the ecstasy of Samuel's
day, is plain from the continuance of the name Nebi'îm
and from these two facts besides: that the ecstasy survives
and that the prophets still live in communities.
The greatest figures of the period, Elijah and Elisha,
have upon them <i>the hand of the Lord</i>, as the influence
is now called: Elijah when he runs before Ahab's
chariot across Esdraelon, Elisha when by music he
induces upon himself the prophetic mood.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Another
ecstatic figure is the prophet who was sent to anoint
Jehu; he swept in and he swept out again, and the
soldiers called him <i>that mad fellow</i>.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But the roving
bands had settled down into more or less stationary
communities, who partly lived by agriculture and partly
by the alms of the people or the endowments of the
crown.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Their centres were either the centres of national
worship, like Bethel and Gilgal, or the centres of government,
like Samaria, where the dynasty of Omri supported
prophets both of Baal and of Jehovah.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> They
were called prophets, but also <i>sons of the prophets</i>, the
latter name not because their office was hereditary, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
by the Oriental fashion of designating every member
of a guild as the son of the guild. In many cases
the son may have succeeded his father; but the ranks
could be recruited from outside, as we see in the case
of the young farmer Elisha, whom Elijah anointed at
the plough. They probably all wore the mantle which
is distinctive of some of them, the mantle of hair, or
skin of a beast.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The risks of degeneration, to which this order of
prophecy was liable, arose both from its ecstatic temper
and from its connection with public affairs.</p>

<p>Religious ecstasy is always dangerous to the moral
and intellectual interests of religion. The largest
prophetic figures of the period, though they feel the
ecstasy, attain their greatness by rising superior to it.
Elijah's raptures are impressive; but nobler are his
defence of Naboth and his denunciation of Ahab. And
so Elisha's inducement of the prophetic mood by music
is the least attractive element in his career: his greatness
lies in his combination of the care of souls
with political insight and vigilance for the national
interests. Doubtless there were many of the sons of
the prophets who with smaller abilities cultivated a
religion as rational and moral. But for the herd
ecstasy would be everything. It was so easily induced
or imitated that much of it cannot have been genuine.
Even where the feeling was at first sincere we can
understand how readily it became morbid; how fatally
it might fall into sympathy with that drunkenness from
wine and that sexual passion which Israel saw already
cultivated as worship by the surrounding Canaanites.
We must feel these dangers of ecstasy if we would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
understand why Amos cut himself off from the Nebi'îm,
and why Hosea laid such emphasis on the moral and
intellectual sides of religion: <i>My people perish for lack
of knowledge</i>. Hosea indeed considered the degeneracy
of ecstasy as a judgment: <i>the prophet is a fool, the man
of the spirit is mad&mdash;for the multitude of thine iniquity</i>.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
A later age derided the ecstatics, and took one of the
forms of the verb <i>to prophesy</i> as equivalent to the verb
<i>to be mad</i>.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>But temptations as gross beset the prophet from that
which should have been the discipline of his ecstasy&mdash;his
connection with public affairs. Only some prophets
were brave rebukers of the king and the people. The
herd which fed at the royal table&mdash;four hundred under
Ahab&mdash;were flatterers, who could not tell the truth,
who said Peace, peace, when there was no peace. These
were false prophets. Yet it is curious that the very
early narrative which describes them<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> does not impute
their falsehood to any base motives of their own, but
to the direct inspiration of God, who sent forth a lying
spirit upon them. So great was the reverence still for
the <i>man of the spirit</i>! Rather than doubt his inspiration,
they held his very lies to be inspired. One does
not of course mean that these consenting prophets were
conscious liars; but that their dependence on the king,
their servile habits of speech, disabled them from seeing
the truth. Subserviency to the powerful was their
great temptation. In the story of Balaam we see
confessed the base instinct that he who paid the prophet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
should have the word of the prophet in his favour.
In Israel prophecy went through exactly the same
struggle between the claims of its God and the claims
of its patrons. Nor were those patrons always the
rich. The bulk of the prophets were dependent on the
charitable gifts of the common people, and in this we
may find reason for that subjection of so many of
them to the vulgar ideals of the national destiny, to signs
of which we are pointed by Amos. The priest at Bethel
only reflects public opinion when he takes for granted
that the prophet is a thoroughly mercenary character:
<i>Seer, get thee gone to the land of Judah; eat there thy
bread, and play the prophet there!</i><a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> No wonder Amos
separates himself from such hireling craftsmen!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was the course of prophecy up to Elisha, and
the borders of the eighth century. We have seen how
even for the ancient prophet, mere soothsayer though
we might regard him in respect of the rude instruments
of his office, there were present moral opportunities
of the highest kind, from which, if he only proved true
to them, we cannot conceive the Spirit of God to have
been absent. In early Israel we are sure that the Spirit
did meet such strong and pure characters, from Moses
to Samuel, creating by their means the nation of Israel,
welding it to a unity, which was not only political but
moral&mdash;and moral to a degree not elsewhere realised
in the Semitic world. We saw how a new race of
prophets arose under Samuel, separate from the older
forms of prophecy by lot and oracle, separate, too, from
the ritual as a whole; and therefore free for a moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and spiritual advance of which the priesthood, still
bound to images and the ancient rites, proved themselves
incapable. But this new order of prophecy,
besides its moral opportunities, had also its moral
perils: its ecstasy was dangerous, its connection with
public affairs was dangerous too. Again, the test was
the personal character of the prophet himself. And
so once more we see raised above the herd great
personalities, who carry forward the work of their
predecessors. The results are, besides the discipline
of the monarchy and the defence of justice and the
poor, the firm establishment of Jehovah as the one
and only God of Israel, and the impression on Israel
both of His omnipotent guidance of them in the past,
and of a worldwide destiny, still vague but brilliant,
which He had prepared for them in the future.</p>

<p>This brings us to Elisha, and from Elisha there are
but forty years to Amos. During those forty years,
however, there arose within Israel a new civilisation;
beyond her there opened up a new world; and with
Assyria there entered the resources of Providence, a
new power. It was these three facts&mdash;the New
Civilisation, the New World and the New Power&mdash;which
made the difference between Elisha and Amos,
and raised prophecy from a national to a universal
religion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE EIGHTH CENTURY IN ISRAEL</i></h3>


<p>The long life of Elisha fell to its rest on the
margin of the eighth century.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He had seen
much evil upon Israel. The people were smitten in
all their coasts. None of their territory across Jordan
was left to them; and not only Hazael and his Syrians,
but bands of their own former subjects, the Moabites,
periodically raided Western Palestine, up to the very
gates of Samaria.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Such a state of affairs determined
the activity of the last of the older prophets. Elisha
spent his life in the duties of the national defence, and
in keeping alive the spirit of Israel against her foes.
When he died they called him <i>Israel's chariot and the
horsemen thereof</i>,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> so incessant had been both his
military vigilance<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and his political insight.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> But
Elisha was able to leave behind him the promise of
a new day of victory.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It was in the peace and liberty
of this day that Israel rose a step in civilisation; that
prophecy, released from the defence, became the criticism,
of the national life; and that the people, no
longer absorbed in their own borders, looked out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
for the first time realised the great world, of which
they were only a part.</p>

<p>King Joash, whose arms the dying Elisha had blessed,
won back in the sixteen years of his reign (798-783)
the cities which the Syrians had taken from his father.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
His successor, Jeroboam II., came in, therefore, with
a flowing tide. He was a strong man, and he took
advantage of it. During his long reign of about forty
years (783-743) he restored the border of Israel from
the Pass of Hamath between the Lebanons to the
Dead Sea, and occupied at least part of the territory
of Damascus.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> This means that the constant raids to
which Israel had been subjected now ceased, and that
by the time of Amos, about 755, a generation was
grown up who had not known defeat, and the most
of whom had perhaps no experience even of war.</p>

<p>Along the same length of years Uzziah (<i>circa</i>
778-740) had dealt similarly with Judah.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> He had
pushed south to the Red Sea, while Jeroboam pushed
north to Hamath; and while Jeroboam had taken the
Syrian towns he had crushed the Philistine. He had
reorganised the army, and invented new engines of
siege for casting stones. On such of his frontiers as
were opposed to the desert he had built towers: there
is no better means of keeping the nomads in subjection.</p>

<p>All this meant such security across broad Israel
as had not been known since the glorious days of
Solomon. Agriculture must everywhere have revived:
Uzziah, the Chronicler tells us, <i>loved husbandry</i>. But
we hear most of Trade and Building. With quarters
in Damascus and a port on the Red Sea, with allies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
in the Ph&#339;nician towns and tributaries in the Philistine,
with command of all the main routes between Egypt
and the North as between the Desert and the Levant,
Israel, during those forty years of Jeroboam and Uzziah,
must have become a busy and a wealthy commercial
power. Hosea calls the Northern Kingdom a very
Canaan<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>&mdash;Canaanite being the Hebrew term for trader&mdash;as
we should say a very Jew; and Amos exposes
all the restlessness, the greed, and the indifference to
the poor of a community making haste to be rich.
The first effect of this was a large increase of the
towns and of town-life. Every document of the time&mdash;up
to 720&mdash;speaks to us of its buildings.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> In ordinary
building houses of ashlar seem to be novel enough
to be mentioned. Vast <i>palaces</i>&mdash;the name of them first
heard of in Israel under Omri and his Ph&#339;nician alliance,
and then only as that of the king's citadel<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>&mdash;are now built
by wealthy grandees out of money extorted from the
poor; they can have risen only since the Syrian wars.
There are summer houses in addition to winter houses;
and it is not only the king, as in the days of Ahab,
who furnishes his buildings with ivory. When an
earthquake comes and whole cities are overthrown, the
vigour and wealth of the people are such that they
build more strongly and lavishly than before.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> With
all this we have the characteristic tempers and moods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of city-life: the fickleness and liability to panic which
are possible only where men are gathered in crowds;
the luxury and false art which are engendered only by
artificial conditions of life; the deep poverty which
in all cities, from the beginning to the end of time,
lurks by the side of the most brilliant wealth, its dark
and inevitable shadow.</p>

<p>In short, in the half-century between Elisha and
Amos, Israel rose from one to another of the great stages
of culture. Till the eighth century they had been but
a kingdom of fighting husbandmen. Under Jeroboam
and Uzziah city-life was developed, and civilisation, in the
proper sense of the word, appeared. Only once before
had Israel taken so large a step: when they crossed
Jordan, leaving the nomadic life for the agricultural; and
that had been momentous for their religion. They
came among new temptations: the use of wine, and the
shrines of local gods who were believed to have more
influence on the fertility of the land than Jehovah who
had conquered it for His people. But now this further
step, from the agricultural stage to the mercantile and
civil, was equally fraught with danger. There was the
closer intercourse with foreign nations and their cults.
There were all the temptations of rapid wealth, all
the dangers of an equally increasing poverty. The
growth of comfort among the rulers meant the growth
of thoughtlessness. Cruelty multiplied with refinement.
The upper classes were lifted away from feeling the
real woes of the people. There was a well-fed and
sanguine patriotism, but at the expense of indifference
to social sin and want. Religious zeal and liberality
increased, but they were coupled with all the proud's
misunderstanding of God: an optimist faith without
moral insight or sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>It is all this which makes the prophets of the eighth
century so modern, while Elisha's life is still so ancient.
With him we are back in the times of our own border
wars&mdash;of Wallace and Bruce, with their struggles for
the freedom of the soil. With Amos we stand among
the conditions of our own day. The City has arisen.
For the development of the highest form of prophecy,
the universal and permanent form, there was needed
that marvellously unchanging mould of human life,
whose needs and sorrows, whose sins and problems,
are to-day the same as they were all those thousands
of years ago.</p>

<p>With Civilisation came Literature. The long peace
gave leisure for writing; and the just pride of the
people in boundaries broad as Solomon's own, determined
that this writing should take the form of
heroic history. In the parallel reigns of Jeroboam and
Uzziah many critics have placed the great epics of
Israel: the earlier documents of our Pentateuch which
trace God's purposes to mankind by Israel, from the
creation of the world to the settlement of the Promised
Land; the histories which make up our Books of
Judges, Samuel and Kings. But whether all these
were composed now or at an earlier date, it is certain
that the nation lived in the spirit of them, proud of
its past, aware of its vocation, and confident that its
God, who had created the world and so mightily led
itself, would bring it from victory by victory to a
complete triumph over the heathen. Israel of the
eighth century were devoted to Jehovah; and although
passion or self-interest might lead individuals or even
communities to worship other gods, He had no possible
rival upon the throne of the nation.</p>

<p>As they delighted to recount His deeds by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
fathers, so they thronged the scenes of these with sacrifice
and festival. Bethel and Beersheba, Dan and Gilgal,
were the principal;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> but Mizpeh, the top of Tabor,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and
Carmel,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> perhaps Penuel,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> were also conspicuous among
the countless <i>high places</i><a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> of the land. Of those in
Northern Israel Bethel was the chief. It enjoyed the
proper site for an ancient shrine, which was nearly
always a market as well&mdash;near a frontier and where
many roads converged; where traders from the East
could meet half-way with traders from the West, the
wool-growers of Moab and the Judæan desert with
the merchants of Ph&#339;nicia and the Philistine coast.
Here, on the spot on which the father of the nation had
seen heaven open,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> a great temple was now built, with
a priesthood endowed and directed by the crown,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
but lavishly supported also by the tithes and free-will
offerings of the people.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> <i>It is a sanctuary of the king
and a house of the kingdom.</i><a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Jeroboam had ordained
Dan, at the other end of the kingdom, to be the fellow
of Bethel;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> but Dan was far away from the bulk of
the people, and in the eighth century Bethel's real rival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
was Gilgal.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Whether this was the Gilgal by Jericho,
or the other Gilgal on the Samarian hills near Shiloh,
is uncertain. The latter had been a sanctuary in
Elijah's day, with a settlement of the prophets; but
the former must have proved the greater attraction
to a people so devoted to the sacred events of their
past. Was it not the first resting-place of the Ark
after the passage of Jordan, the scene of the reinstitution
of circumcision, of the anointing of the
first king, of Judah's second submission to David?<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
As there were many Gilgals in the land&mdash;literally <i>cromlechs</i>,
ancient <i>stone-circles</i> sacred to the Canaanites as
well as to Israel&mdash;so there were many Mizpehs, <i>Watchtowers</i>,
<i>Seers' stations</i>: the one mentioned by Hosea
was probably in Gilead.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> To the southern Beersheba,
to which Elijah had fled from Jezebel, pilgrimages were
made by northern Israelites traversing Judah. The
sanctuary on Carmel was the ancient altar of Jehovah
which Elijah had rebuilt; but Carmel seems at this
time to have lain, as it did so often, in the power of
the Ph&#339;nicians, for it is imagined by the prophets only
as a hiding-place from the face of Jehovah.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>At all these sanctuaries it was Jehovah and no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
who was sought: <i>thy God, O Israel, which brought thee
up out of the land of Egypt</i>.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> At Bethel and at Dan
He was adored in the form of a calf; probably at Gilgal
also, for there is a strong tradition to that effect;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and
elsewhere men still consulted the other images which
had been used by Saul and by David, the Ephod and
the Teraphim.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> With these there was the old Semitic
symbol of the Maççebah, or upright stone on which
oil was poured.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> All of them had been used in the
worship of Jehovah by the great examples and leaders
of the past; all of them had been spared by Elijah
and Elisha: it was no wonder that the common people
of the eighth century felt them to be indispensable
elements of religion, the removal of which, like the
removal of the monarchy or of sacrifice itself, would
mean utter divorce from the nation's God.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>One great exception must be made. Compared with
the sanctuaries we have mentioned, Zion itself was
very modern. But it contained the main repository
of Israel's religion, the Ark, and in connection with
the Ark the worship of Jehovah was not a worship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
images. It is significant that from this, the original
sanctuary of Israel, with the pure worship, the new
prophecy derived its first inspiration. But to that
we shall return later with Amos.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Apart from the Ark,
Jerusalem was not free from images, nor even from the
altars of foreign deities.</p>

<p>Where the externals of the ritual were thus so much
the same as those of the Canaanite cults, which were still
practised in and around the land, it is not surprising
that the worship of Jehovah should be further invaded
by many pagan practices, nor that Jehovah Himself
should be regarded with imaginations steeped in pagan
ideas of the Godhead. That even the foulest tempers
of the Canaanite ritual, those inspired by wine and the
sexual passion, were licensed in the sanctuaries of
Israel, both Amos and Hosea testify. But the worst
of the evil was wrought in the popular conception of
God. Let us remember again that Jehovah had no
real rival at this time in the devotion of His people,
and that their faith was expressed both by the legal
forms of His religion and by a liberality which
exceeded these. The tithes were paid to Him, and
paid, it would appear, with more than legal frequency.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
Sabbath and New Moon, as days of worship and rest
from business, were observed with a Pharisaic scrupulousness
for the letter if not for the spirit.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The
prescribed festivals were held, and thronged by zealous
devotees who rivalled each other in the amount of their
free-will offerings.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Pilgrimages were made to Bethel,
to Gilgal, to far Beersheba, and the very way to the
latter appeared as sacred to the Israelite as the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
to Mecca does to a pious Moslem of to-day.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Yet, in
spite of all this devotion to their God, Israel had no
true ideas of Him. To quote Amos, they sought His
sanctuaries, but Him they did not seek; in the words
of Hosea's frequent plaint, they <i>did not know Him</i>.
To the mass of the people, to their governors, their
priests, and the most of their prophets, Jehovah was
but the characteristic Semitic deity&mdash;patron of His
people, and caring for them alone&mdash;who had helped
them in the past, and was bound to help them still&mdash;very
jealous as to the correctness of His ritual and
the amount of His sacrifices, but indifferent about real
morality. Nay, there were still darker streaks in their
views of Him. A god, figured as an ox, could not
be adored by a cattle-breeding people without starting
in their minds thoughts too much akin to the foul
tempers of the Canaanite faiths. These things it is
almost a shame to mention; but without knowing that
they fermented in the life of that generation, we shall
not appreciate the vehemence of Amos or of Hosea.</p>

<p>Such a religion had no discipline for the busy,
mercenary life of the day. Injustice and fraud were
rife in the very precincts of the sanctuary. Magistrates
and priests alike were smitten with their generation's
love of money, and did everything for reward. Again
and again do the prophets speak of bribery. Judges
took gifts and perverted the cause of the poor; priests
drank the mulcted wine, and slept on the pledged
garments of religious offenders. There was no disinterested
service of God or of the commonweal. Mammon
was supreme. The influence of the commercial character
of the age appears in another very remarkable result.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
An agricultural community is always sensitive to the
religion of nature. They are awed by its chastisements&mdash;droughts,
famines and earthquakes. They feel its
majestic order in the course of the seasons, the procession
of day and night, the march of the great stars
all the host of the Lord of hosts. But Amos seems to
have had to break into passionate reminders of Him that
maketh Orion and the Pleiades, and turneth the murk
into morning.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Several physical calamities visited the
land. The locusts are bad in Palestine every sixth
or seventh year: one year before Amos began they
had been very bad. There was a monstrous drought,
followed by a famine. There was a long-remembered
earthquake&mdash;<i>the earthquake in the days of Uzziah</i>.
With Egypt so near, the home of the plague, and
with so much war afoot in Northern Syria, there were
probably more pestilences in Western Asia than those
recorded in 803, 765 and 759. There was a total
eclipse of the sun in 763. But of all these, except
perhaps the pestilence, a commercial people are independent
as an agricultural are not. Israel speedily
recovered from them, without any moral improvement.
Even when the earthquake came <i>they said in pride and
stoutness of heart, The bricks are fallen down, but we will
build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we
will change to cedars</i>.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> It was a marvellous generation&mdash;so
joyous, so energetic, so patriotic, so devout! But
its strength was the strength of cruel wealth, its peace
the peace of an immoral religion.</p>

<p>I have said that the age is very modern, and we
shall indeed go to its prophets feeling that they speak
to conditions of life extremely like our own. But if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
we wish a still closer analogy from our history, we
must travel back to the fourteenth century in England&mdash;Langland's
and Wyclif's century, which, like this one
in Israel, saw both the first real attempts towards a
national literature, and the first real attempts towards
a moral and religious reform. Then as in Israel a long
and victorious reign was drawing to a close, under the
threat of disaster when it should have passed. Then
as in Israel there had been droughts, earthquakes and
pestilences with no moral results upon the nation.
Then also there was a city life developing at the expense
of country life. Then also the wealthy began to
draw aloof from the people. Then also there was
a national religion, zealously cultivated and endowed
by the liberality of the people, but superstitious,
mercenary, and corrupted by sexual disorder. Then
too there were many pilgrimages to popular shrines,
and the land was strewn with mendicant priests and
hireling preachers. And then too prophecy raised its
voice, for the first time fearless in England. As we
study the verses of Amos we shall find again and
again the most exact parallels to them in the verses of
Langland's <i>Vision of Piers the Plowman</i>, which denounce
the same vices in Church and State, and enforce the
same principles of religion and morality.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was when the reign of Jeroboam was at its height
of assured victory, when the nation's prosperity seemed
impregnable after the survival of those physical calamities,
when the worship and the commerce were in full course
throughout the land, that the first of the new prophets
broke out against Israel in the name of Jehovah,
threatening judgment alike upon the new civilisation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of which they were so proud and the old religion in
which they were so confident. These prophets were
inspired by feelings of the purest morality, by the
passionate conviction that God could no longer bear
such impurity and disorder. But, as we have seen,
no prophet in Israel ever worked on the basis of
principles only. He came always in alliance with
events. These first appeared in the shape of the great
physical disasters. But a more powerful instrument of
Providence, in the service of judgment, was appearing
on the horizon. This was the Assyrian Empire.
So vast was its influence on prophecy that we must
devote to it a separate chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE INFLUENCE OF ASSYRIA UPON PROPHECY</i></h3>


<p>By far the greatest event in the eighth century
before Christ was the appearance of Assyria in
Palestine. To Israel since the Exodus and Conquest,
nothing had happened capable of so enormous an
influence at once upon their national fortunes and their
religious development. But while the Exodus and
Conquest had advanced the political and spiritual progress
of Israel in equal proportion, the effect of the
Assyrian invasion was to divorce these two interests,
and destroy the state while it refined and confirmed
the religion. After permitting the Northern Kingdom
to reach an extent and splendour unrivalled since
the days of Solomon, Assyria overthrew it in 721
and left all Israel scarcely a third of their former
magnitude. But while Assyria proved so disastrous
to the state, her influence upon the prophecy of the
period was little short of creative. Humanly speaking,
this highest stage of Israel's religion could not have
been achieved by the prophets except in alliance with
the armies of that heathen empire. Before then we turn
to their pages it may be well for us to make clear in
what directions Assyria performed this spiritual service
for Israel. While pursuing this inquiry we may be
able to find answers to the scarcely less important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
questions: why the prophets were at first doubtful of
the part Assyria was destined to play in the providence
of the Almighty? and why, when the prophets were
at last convinced of the certainty of Israel's overthrow,
the statesmen of Israel and the bulk of the people still
remained so unconcerned about her coming, or so
sanguine of their power to resist her? This requires,
to begin with, a summary of the details of the Assyrian
advance upon Palestine.</p>

<p>In the far past Palestine had often been the hunting-ground
of the Assyrian kings. But after 1100 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
and for nearly two centuries and a half, her states
were left to themselves. Then Assyria resumed the
task of breaking down that disbelief in her power
with which her long withdrawal seems to have inspired
their politics. In 870 Assurnasirpal reached the
Levant, and took tribute from Tyre and Sidon. Omri
was reigning in Samaria, and must have come into
close relations with the Assyrians, for during more
than a century and a half after his death they still
called the land of Israel by his name.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In 854
Salmanassar II. defeated at Karkar the combined
forces of Ahab and Benhadad. In 850, 849 and 846
he conducted campaigns against Damascus. In 842
he received tribute from Jehu,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and in 839 again fought
Damascus under Hazael. After this there passed a
whole generation during which Assyria came no farther
south than Arpad, some sixty miles north of Damascus;
and Hazael employed the respite in those campaigns
which proved so disastrous for Israel, by robbing her
of the provinces across Jordan, and ravaging the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
country about Samaria.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> In 803 Assyria returned,
and accomplished the siege and capture of Damascus.
The first consequence to Israel was that restoration
of her hopes under Joash, at which the aged Elisha
was still spared to assist,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and which reached its fulfilment
in the recovery of all Eastern Palestine by
Jeroboam II.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Jeroboam's own relations to Assyria
have not been recorded either by the Bible or by the
Assyrian monuments. It is hard to think that he paid
no tribute to the "king of kings." At all events it
is certain that, while Assyria again overthrew the
Arameans of Damascus in 773 and their neighbours
of Hadrach in 772 and 765, Jeroboam was himself
invading Aramean land, and the Book of Kings even
attributes to him an extension of territory, or at least
of political influence, up to the northern mouth of the
great pass between the Lebanons.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> For the next twenty
years Assyria only once came as far as Lebanon&mdash;to
Hadrach in 759&mdash;and it may have been this long
quiescence which enabled the rulers and people of Israel
to forget, if indeed their religion and sanguine patriotism
had ever allowed them to realise, how much the conquests
and splendour of Jeroboam's reign were due, not
to themselves, but to the heathen power which had
maimed their oppressors. Their dreams were brief.
Before Jeroboam himself was dead, a new king had
usurped the Assyrian throne (745 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) and inaugurated
a more vigorous policy. Borrowing the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
ancient Tiglath-Pileser, he followed that conqueror's
path across the Euphrates. At first it seemed as if he
was to suffer check. His forces were engrossed by the
siege of Arpad for three years (<i>c.</i> 743), and this delay,
along with that of two years more, during which he
had to return to the conquest of Babylon, may well
have given cause to the courts of Damascus and
Samaria to believe that the Assyrian power had not
really revived. Combining, they attacked Judah under
Ahaz. But Ahaz appealed to Tiglath-Pileser, who
within a year (734-733) had overthrown Damascus and
carried captive the populations of Gilead and Galilee.
There could now be no doubt as to what the Assyrian
power meant for the political fortunes of Israel. Before
this resistless and inexorable empire, the people of
Jehovah were as the most frail of their neighbours&mdash;sure
of defeat, and sure, too, of that terrible captivity
in exile which formed the novel policy of the invaders
against the tribes who withstood them. Israel dared
to withstand. The vassal Hoshea, whom the Assyrians
had placed on the throne of Samaria in 730, kept back
his tribute. The people rallied to him; and for more
than three years this little tribe of highlanders resisted
in their capital the Assyrian siege. Then came the
end. Samaria fell in 721, and Israel went into captivity
beyond the Euphrates.</p>

<p>In following the course of this long tragedy, a man's
heart cannot but feel that <i>all</i> the splendour and the
glory did not lie with the prophets, in spite of their
being the only actors in the drama who perceived its
moral issues and predicted its actual end. For who
can withhold admiration from those few tribesmen,
who accepted no defeat as final, but so long as they
were left to their fatherland rallied their ranks to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
liberty and defied the huge empire. Nor was their
courage always as blind, as in the time of Isaiah
Samaria's so fatally became. For one cannot have
failed to notice, how fitful and irregular was Assyria's
advance, at least up to the reign of Tiglath-Pileser;
nor how prolonged and doubtful were her sieges of
some of the towns. The Assyrians themselves do not
always record spoil or tribute after what they are
pleased to call their victories over the cities of Palestine.
To the same campaign they had often to return for
several years in succession.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> It took Tiglath-Pileser
himself three years to reduce Arpad; Salmanassar IV.
besieged Samaria for three years, and was slain before
it yielded. These facts enable us to understand that,
apart from the moral reasons which the prophets urged
for the certainty of Israel's overthrow by Assyria, it
was always within the range of political possibility that
Assyria would not come back, and that while she was
engaged with revolts of other portions of her huge and
disorganised empire, a combined revolution on the
part of her Syrian vassals would be successful. The
prophets themselves felt the influence of these chances.
They were not always confident, as we shall see, that
Assyria was to be the means of Israel's overthrow.
Amos, and in his earlier years Isaiah, describe her
with a caution and a vagueness for which there is no
other explanation than the political uncertainty that
again and again hung over the future of her advance
upon Syria. It, then, even in those high minds, to
whom the moral issue was so clear, the political form
that issue should assume was yet temporarily uncertain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
what good reasons must the mere statesmen of Syria
have often felt for the proud security which filled
the intervals between the Assyrian invasions, or the
sanguine hopes which inspired their resistance to the
latter.</p>

<p>We must not cast over the whole Assyrian advance
the triumphant air of the annals of such kings as
Tiglath-Pileser or Sennacherib. Campaigning in Palestine
was a dangerous business even to the Romans;
and for the Assyrian armies there was always possible
besides some sudden recall by the rumour of a revolt
in a distant province. Their own annals supply us
with good reasons for the sanguine resistance offered
to them by the tribes of Palestine. No defeat, of
course, is recorded; but the annals are full of delays
and withdrawals. Then the Plague would break
out; we know how in the last year of the century
it turned Sennacherib, and saved Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> In
short, up almost to the end the Syrian chiefs had some
fair political reasons for resistance to a power which
had so often defeated them; while at the very end,
when no such reason remained and our political
sympathy is exhausted, we feel it replaced by an even
warmer admiration for their desperate defence. Mere
mountain-cats of tribes as some of them were, they
held their poorly furnished rocks against one, two or
three years of cruel siege.</p>

<p>In Israel these political reasons for courage against
Assyria were enforced by the whole instincts of the
popular religion. The century had felt a new outburst
of enthusiasm for Jehovah.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> This was consequent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
not only upon the victories He had granted
over Aram, but upon the literature of the peace which
followed those victories: the collection of the stories
of the ancient miracles of Jehovah in the beginning
of His people's history, and of the purpose He had
even then announced of bringing Israel to supreme
rank in the world. Such a God, so anciently manifested,
so recently proved, could never surrender His
own nation to a mere Goî<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>&mdash;a heathen and a barbarian
people. Add this dogma of the popular religion of
Israel to those substantial hopes of Assyria's withdrawal
from Palestine, and you see cause, intelligible
and adequate, for the complacency of Jeroboam and
his people to the fact that Assyria had at last, by the
fall of Damascus, reached their own borders, as well
as for the courage with which Hoshea in 725 threw
off the Assyrian yoke, and, with a willing people, for
three years defended Samaria against the great king.
Let us not think that the opponents of the prophets
were utter fools or mere puppets of fate. They had
reasons for their optimism; they fought for their hearths
and altars with a valour and a patience which proves
that the nation as a whole was not so corrupt, as
we are sometimes, by the language of the prophets,
tempted to suppose.</p>

<p>But all this&mdash;the reasonableness of the hope of
resisting Assyria, the valour which so stubbornly
fought her, the religious faith which sanctioned both
valour and hope&mdash;only the more vividly illustrates the
singular independence of the prophets, who took an
opposite view, who so consistently affirmed that Israel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
must fall, and so early foretold that she should fall
to Assyria.</p>

<p>The reason of this conviction of the prophets was,
of course, their fundamental faith in the righteousness
of Jehovah. That was a belief quite independent
of the course of events. As a matter of history, the
ethical reasons for Israel's doom were manifest to the
prophets within Israel's own life, before the signs
grew clear on the horizon that the doomster was to be
Assyria.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Nay, we may go further, and say that it
could not possibly have been otherwise. For except
the prophets had been previously furnished with the
ethical reasons for Assyria's resistless advance on
Israel, to their sensitive minds that advance must have
been a hopeless and a paralysing problem. But they
nowhere treat it as a problem. By them Assyria is
always either welcomed as a proof or summoned as a
means&mdash;the proof of their conviction that Israel requires
humbling, the means of carrying that humbling
into effect. The faith of the prophets is ready for
Assyria from the moment that she becomes ominous
for Israel, and every footfall of her armies on Jehovah's
soil becomes the corroboration of the purpose He has
already declared to His servants in the terms of their
moral consciousness. The spiritual service which
Assyria rendered to Israel was therefore secondary to
the prophets' native convictions of the righteousness
of God, and could not have been performed without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
these. This will become even more clear if we look
for a little at the exact nature of that service.</p>

<p>In its broadest effects, the Assyrian invasion meant
for Israel a very considerable change in the intellectual
outlook. Hitherto Israel's world had virtually lain
between the borders promised of old to their ambition&mdash;<i>the
river of Egypt,</i><a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> <i>and the great river, the River
Euphrates</i>. These had marked not merely the sphere
of Israel's politics, but the horizon within which Israel
had been accustomed to observe the action of their
God and to prove His character, to feel the problems of
their religion rise and to grapple with them. But now
there burst from the outside of this little world that
awful power, sovereign and inexorable, which effaced all
distinctions and treated Israel in the same manner as
her heathen neighbours. This was more than a
widening of the world: it was a change of the very
poles. At first sight it appeared merely to have increased
the scale on which history was conducted;
it was really an alteration of the whole character
of history. Religion itself shrivelled up, before a force
so much vaster than anything it had yet encountered,
and so contemptuous of its claims. <i>What is Jehovah</i>,
said the Assyrian in his laughter, <i>more than the gods of
Damascus, or of Hamath, or of the Philistines</i>? In fact,
for the mind of Israel, the crisis, though less in degree,
was in quality not unlike that produced in the religion
of Europe by the revelation of the Copernican astronomy.
As the earth, previously believed to be the centre of
the universe, the stage on which the Son of God had
achieved God's eternal purposes to mankind, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
discovered to be but a satellite of one of innumerable
suns, a mere ball swung beside millions of others by
a force which betrayed no sign of sympathy with the
great transactions which took place on it, and so faith
in the Divine worth of these was rudely shaken&mdash;so
Israel, who had believed themselves to be the peculiar
people of the Creator, the solitary agents of the God
of Righteousness to all mankind,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and who now felt
themselves brought to an equality with other tribes
by this sheer force, which, brutally indifferent to
spiritual distinctions, swayed the fortunes of all alike,
must have been tempted to unbelief in the spiritual
facts of their history, in the power of their God and
the destiny He had promised them. Nothing could
have saved Israel, as nothing could have saved Europe,
but a conception of God which rose to this new
demand upon its powers&mdash;a faith which said, "Our
God is sufficient for this greater world and its forces
that so dwarf our own; the discovery of these only
excites in us a more awful wonder of His power."
The prophets had such a conception of God. To
them He was absolute righteousness&mdash;righteousness
wide as the widest world, stronger than the strongest
force. To the prophets, therefore, the rise of Assyria
only increased the possibilities of Providence. But
it could not have done this had Providence not already
been invested in a God capable by His character of
rising to such possibilities.</p>

<p>Assyria, however, was not only Force: she was also
the symbol of a great Idea&mdash;the Idea of Unity. We
have just ventured on one historical analogy. We
may try another and a more exact one. The Empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of Rome, grasping the whole world in its power and
reducing all races of men to much the same level of
political rights, powerfully assisted Christian theology
in the task of imposing upon the human mind a clearer
imagination of unity in the government of the world
and of spiritual equality among men of all nations.
A not dissimilar service to the faith of Israel was
performed by the Empire of Assyria. History, that
hitherto had been but a series of angry pools, became
as the ocean swaying in tides to one almighty impulse.
It was far easier to imagine a sovereign Providence
when Assyria reduced history to a unity by overthrowing
all the rulers and all their gods, than when
history was broken up into the independent fortunes
of many states, each with its own religion divinely
valid in its own territory. By shattering the tribes
Assyria shattered the tribal theory of religion, which
we have seen to be the characteristic Semitic theory&mdash;a
god for every tribe, a tribe for every god. The field
was cleared of the many: there was room for the One.
That He appeared, not as the God of the conquering
race, but as the Deity of one of their many victims, was
due to Jehovah's righteousness. At this juncture, when
the world was suggested to have one throne and that
throne was empty, there was a great chance, if we
may so put it, for a god with a character. And the
only God in all the Semitic world who had a character
was Jehovah.</p>

<p>It is true that the Assyrian Empire was not constructive,
like the Roman, and, therefore, could not assist
the prophets to the idea of a Catholic Church. But
there can be no doubt that it did assist them to a
feeling of the moral unity of mankind. A great historian
has made the just remark that, whatsoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
widens the imagination, enabling it to realise the
actual experience of other men, is a powerful agent
of ethical advance.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Now Assyria widened the imagination
and the sympathy of Israel in precisely this
way. Consider the universal Pity of the Assyrian
conquest: how state after state went down before it,
how all things mortal yielded and were swept away.
The mutual hatreds and ferocities of men could not
persist before a common Fate, so sublime, so tragic.
And thus we understand how in Israel the old envies
and rancours of that border warfare with her foes which
had filled the last four centuries of her history is
replaced by a new tenderness and compassion towards
the national efforts, the achievements and all the busy
life of the Gentile peoples. Isaiah is especially distinguished
by this in his treatment of Egypt and of
Tyre; and even where he and others do not, as in
these cases, appreciate the sadness of the destruction
of so much brave beauty and serviceable wealth, their
tone in speaking of the fall of the Assyrian on their
neighbours is one of compassion and not of exultation.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
As the rivalries and hatreds of individual lives are
stilled in the presence of a common death, so even that
factious, ferocious world of the Semites ceased to <i>fret its
anger and watch it for ever</i> (to quote Amos' phrase) in
face of the universal Assyrian Fate. But in that Fate
there was more than Pity. On the data of the prophets
Assyria was afflicting Israel for moral reasons: it could
not be for other reasons that she was afflicting their
neighbours. Israel and the heathen were suffering for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the same righteousness' sake. What could have better
illustrated the moral equality of all mankind! No
doubt the prophets were already theoretically convinced<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
of this&mdash;for the righteousness they believed
in was nothing if not universal. But it is one thing to
hold a belief on principle and another to have practical
experience of it in history. To a theory of the moral
equality of mankind Assyria enabled the prophets to
add sympathy and conscience. We shall see all this
illustrated in the opening prophecies of Amos against
the foreign nations.</p>

<p>But Assyria did not help to develop monotheism in
Israel only by contributing to the doctrines of a moral
Providence and of the equality of all men beneath it.
The influence must have extended to Israel's conception
of God in Nature. Here, of course, Israel was already
possessed of great beliefs. Jehovah had created man;
He had divided the Red Sea and Jordan. The desert,
the storm, and the seasons were all subject to Him.
But at a time when the superstitious mind of the
people was still feeling after other Divine powers in
the earth, the waters and the air of Canaan, it was a
very valuable antidote to such dissipation of their faith
to find one God swaying, through Assyria, all families
of mankind. The Divine unity to which history was
reduced must have reacted on Israel's views of Nature,
and made it easier to feel one God also there. Now, as
a matter of fact, the imagination of the unity of Nature,
the belief in a reason and method pervading all things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
was very powerfully advanced in Israel throughout the
Assyrian period.</p>

<p>We may find an illustration of this in the greater,
deeper meaning in which the prophets use the old
national name of Israel's God&mdash;Jehovah &#7778;eba'oth,
<i>Jehovah of Hosts</i>. This title, which came into frequent
use under the early kings, when Israel's vocation was
to win freedom by war, meant then (as far as we can
gather) only <i>Jehovah of the armies of Israel</i>&mdash;the God
of battles, the people's leader in war,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> whose home was
Jerusalem, the people's capital, and His sanctuary their
battle emblem, the Ark. Now the prophets hear
Jehovah go forth (as Amos does) from the same place,
but to them the Name has a far deeper significance.
They never define it, but they use it in associations
where <i>hosts</i> must mean something different from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
armies of Israel. To Amos the hosts of Jehovah are
not the armies of Israel, but those of Assyria: they are
also the nations whom He marshals and marches across
the earth, Philistines from Caphtor, Aram from Qir, as
well as Israel from Egypt. Nay, more; according to
those Doxologies which either Amos or a kindred spirit
has added to his lofty argument,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Jehovah sways and
orders the powers of the heavens: Orion and Pleiades,
the clouds from the sea to the mountain peaks where they
break, day and night in constant procession. It is in
associations like these that the Name is used, either in
its old form or slightly changed as <i>Jehovah God of hosts</i>,
or <i>the hosts</i>; and we cannot but feel that the hosts
of Jehovah are now looked upon as all the influences
of earth and heaven&mdash;human armies, stars and powers
of nature, which obey His word and work His will.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE BOOK OF AMOS</i></h3>


<p>The genuineness of the bulk of the Book of Amos
is not doubted by any critic. The only passages
suspected as interpolations are the three references to
Judah, the three famous outbreaks in praise of the
might of Jehovah the Creator, the final prospect of a
hope that does not gleam in any other part of the book,
with a few clauses alleged to reflect a stage of history
later than that in which Amos worked.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In all, these
verses amount to only twenty-six or twenty-seven out
of one hundred and forty-six. Each of them can be
discussed separately as we reach it, and we may now
pass to consider the general course of the prophecy
which is independent of them.</p>

<p>The Book of Amos consists of Three Groups of
Oracles, under one title, which is evidently meant to
cover them all.</p>

<p>The title runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Words of 'Amo&#7779;&mdash;who was of the herdsmen of
Te&#7731;ôa'&mdash;which he saw concerning Israel in the days</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
<i>of 'Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of
Jarab'am son of Joash,</i><a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> <i>king of Israel: two years
before the earthquake.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The Three Sections, with their contents, are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">First Section: Chaps. I., II. The Heathen's
Crimes and Israel's.</span></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>A series of short oracles of the same form, directed impartially
against the political crimes of all the states of Palestine, and
culminating in a more detailed denunciation of the social evils of
Israel, whose doom is foretold, beneath the same flood of war as
shall overwhelm all her neighbours.</p></blockquote>

<h4><span class="smcap">Second Section: Chaps. III.-VI. Israel's
Crimes and Doom.</span></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>A series of various oracles of denunciation, which have no
further logical connection than is supplied by a general sameness
of subject, and a perceptible increase of detail and articulateness
from beginning to end of the section. They are usually grouped
according to the recurrence of the formula <i>Hear this word</i>, which
stands at the head of our present chaps. iii., iv. and v.; and by
the two cries of <i>Woe</i> at v. 18 and vi. 1. But even more obvious
than these commencements are the various climaxes to which
they lead up. These are all threats of judgment, and each is
more strenuous or explicit than the one that has preceded it.
They close with iii. 15, iv. 3, iv. 12, v. 17, v. 27 and vi. 14; and
according to them the oracles may be conveniently divided into
six groups.</p>

<p>1. III. 1-15. After the main theme of judgment is stated
in 1, 2, we have in 3-8 a parenthesis on the prophet's right
to threaten doom; after which 9-15, following directly on 2,
emphasise the social disorder, threaten the land with invasion,
the people with extinction and the overthrow of their civilisation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>2. IV. 1-3, beginning with the formula <i>Hear this word</i>, is
directed against women and describes the siege of the capital
and their captivity.</p>

<p>3. IV. 4-12, with no opening formula, contrasts the people's
vain propitiation of God by ritual with His treatment of them
by various physical chastisements&mdash;drought, blight and locusts,
pestilence, earthquake&mdash;and summons them to prepare for
another, unnamed, visitation. <i>Jehovah God of Hosts is His
Name.</i></p>

<p>4. V. 1-17, beginning with the formula <i>Hear this word</i>, and
a dirge over a vision of the nation's defeat, attacks, like the
previous group, the lavish ritual, sets in contrast to it Jehovah's
demands for justice and civic purity; and, offering a reprieve
if Israel will repent, closes with the prospect of an universal
mourning (vv. 16, 17), which, though introduced by a <i>therefore</i>,
has no logical connection with what precedes it.</p>

<p>5. V. 18-26 is the first of the two groups that open with <i>Woe</i>.
Affirming that the eagerly expected <i>Day of Jehovah</i> will be darkness
and disaster on disaster inevitable (18-20), it again emphasises
Jehovah's desire for righteousness rather than worship (21-26),
and closes with the threat of captivity beyond Damascus.
<i>Jehovah God of Hosts is His Name</i>, as at the close of 3.</p>

<p>6. VI. 1-14. The second <i>Woe</i>, on them <i>that are at ease in
Zion</i> (1, 2): a satire on the luxuries of the rich and their indifference
to the national suffering (3-6): captivity must come,
with the desolation of the land (9, 10); and in a peroration the
prophet reiterates a general downfall of the nation because of
its perversity. <i>A Nation</i>&mdash;needless to name it!&mdash;will oppress
Israel from Hamath to the River of the Arabah.</p></blockquote>

<h4><span class="smcap"><a id="Third_Section"></a>Third Section: Chaps. VII.-IX. Visions with
Interludes.</span></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>The Visions betray traces of development; but they are interrupted
by a piece of narrative and addresses on the same themes
as chaps. iii.-vi. The <span class="smcap">First two Visions</span> (vii. 1-6) are of
disasters&mdash;locusts and drought&mdash;in the realm of nature; they are
averted by prayer from Amos. The <span class="smcap">Third</span> (7-9) is in the sphere,
not of nature, but history: Jehovah standing with a plumbline,
as if to show the nation's fabric to be utterly twisted, announces
that it shall be overthrown, and that the dynasty of Jeroboam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
must be put to the sword. Upon this mention of the king, the first
in the book, there starts the narrative (10-17) of how Amaziah,
priest at Bethel&mdash;obviously upon hearing the prophet's threat&mdash;sent
word to Jeroboam; and then (whether before or after
getting a reply) proceeded to silence Amos, who, however,
reiterates his prediction of doom, again described as captivity in a
foreign land, and adds a <span class="smcap">Fourth Vision</span> (viii. 1-3), of the &#7730;aits
or <i>Summer Fruit</i>, which suggests &#7730;êts, or <i>End</i> of the Nation.
Here it would seem Amos' discourses at Bethel take end. Then
comes viii. 4-6, another exposure of the sins of the rich; followed
by a triple pronouncement of doom (7), again in the terms of
physical calamities&mdash;earthquake (8), eclipse (9, 10), and famine
(11-14), in the last of which the public worship is again attacked.
A <span class="smcap">Fifth Vision</span>, of the Lord by the Altar commanding to smite
(ix. 1), is followed by a powerful threat of the hopelessness of
escape from God's punishment (ix. 1<i>b</i>-4); the third of the great
apostrophes to the might of Jehovah (5, 6); another statement of
the equality in judgment of Israel with other peoples, and of their
utter destruction (7-8<i>a</i>). Then (8<i>b</i>) we meet the first qualification
of the hitherto unrelieved sentence of death. Captivity is described,
not as doom, but as discipline (9): the sinners of the
people, scoffers at doom, shall die (10). And this seems to leave
room for two final oracles of restoration and glory, the only two
in the book, which are couched in the exact terms of the promises
of later prophecy (11-15) and are by many denied to Amos.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such is the course of the prophesying of Amos. To
have traced it must have made clear to us the unity of
his book,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> as well as the character of the period to which
he belonged. But it also furnishes us with a good deal
of evidence towards the answer of such necessary
questions as these&mdash;whether we can fix an exact date
for the whole or any part, and whether we can trace any
logical or historical development through the chapters,
either as these now stand, or in some such re-arrangement
as we saw to be necessary for the authentic
prophecies of Isaiah.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>Let us take first the simplest of these tasks&mdash;to ascertain
the general period of the book. Twice&mdash;by the title
and by the portion of narrative<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>&mdash;we are pointed to the
reign of Jeroboam II., <i>circa</i> 783-743; other historical
allusions suit the same years. The principalities of
Palestine are all standing, except Gath;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> but the great
northern cloud which carries their doom has risen and
is ready to burst. Now Assyria, we have seen, had
become fatal to Palestine as early as 854. Infrequent
invasions of Syria had followed, in one of which, in
803, Rimmon Nirari III. had subjected Tyre and
Sidon, besieged Damascus, and received tribute from
Israel. So far then as the Assyrian data are concerned,
the Book of Amos might have been written early in the
reign of Jeroboam. Even then was the storm lowering
as he describes it. Even then had the lightning broken
over Damascus. There are other symptoms, however,
which demand a later date. They seem to imply, not
only Uzziah's overthrow of Gath,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and Jeroboam's conquest
of Moab<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and of Aram,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> but that establishment of
Israel's political influence from Lebanon to the Dead
Sea, which must have taken Jeroboam several years
to accomplish. With this agree other features of the
prophecy&mdash;the sense of political security in Israel, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
large increase of wealth, the ample and luxurious
buildings, the gorgeous ritual, the easy ability to
recover from physical calamities, the consequent carelessness
and pride of the upper classes. All these
things imply that the last Syrian invasions of Israel in
the beginning of the century were at least a generation
behind the men into whose careless faces the prophet
hurled his words of doom. During this interval Assyria
had again advanced&mdash;in 775, in 773 and in 772.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> None
of these expeditions, however, had come south of
Damascus, and this, their invariable arrest at some
distance from the proper territory of Israel, may have
further flattered the people's sense of security, though
probably the truth was that Jeroboam, like some of his
predecessors, bought his peace by tribute to the emperor.
In 765, when the Assyrians for the second time invaded
Hadrach, in the neighbourhood of Damascus, their
records mention a pestilence, which, both because their
armies were then in Syria, and because the plague
generally spreads over the whole of Western Asia, may
well have been the pestilence mentioned by Amos. In
763 a total eclipse of the sun took place, and is perhaps
implied by the ninth verse of his eighth chapter. If
this double allusion to pestilence and eclipse be correct,
it brings the book down to the middle of the century
and the latter half of Jeroboam's long reign. In 755
the Assyrians came back to Hadrach; in 754 to Arpad:
with these exceptions Syria was untroubled by them
till after 745. It was probably these quiet years in
which Amos found Israel <i>at ease in Zion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> If we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
went down further, within the more forward policy of
Tiglath-Pileser, who ascended the throne in 745 and
besieged Arpad from 743 to 740, we should find an
occasion for the urgency with which Amos warns
Israel that the invasion of her land and the overthrow
of the dynasty of Jeroboam will be immediate.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> But
Amos might have spoken as urgently even before
Tiglath-Pileser's accession; and the probability that
Hosea, who prophesied within Jeroboam's reign, quotes
from Amos seems to imply that the prophecies of the
latter had been current for some time.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the eighth century&mdash;is, therefore,
the most definite date to which we are able to
assign the Book of Amos. At so great a distance the
difference of a few unmarked years is invisible. It is
enough that we know the moral dates&mdash;the state of
national feeling, the personages alive, the great events
which are behind the prophet, and the still greater
which are imminent. We can see that Amos wrote in
the political pride of the latter years of Jeroboam's
reign, after the pestilence and eclipse of the sixties,
and before the advance of Tiglath-Pileser in the last
forties, of the eighth century.</p>

<p>A particular year is indeed offered by the title of the
book, which, if not by Amos himself, must be from only
a few years later:<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> <i>Words of Amos, which he saw in
the days of Uzziah and of Jeroboam, two years before the
earthquake</i>. This was the great earthquake of which
other prophets speak as having happened in the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of Uzziah.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> But we do not know where to place the
year of the earthquake, and are as far as ever from a
definite date.</p>

<p>The mention of the earthquake, however, introduces
us to the answer of another of our questions&mdash;whether,
with all its unity, the Book of Amos reveals any lines
of progress, either of event or of idea, either historical
or logical.</p>

<p>Granting the truth of the title, that Amos had his
prophetic eyes opened two years before the earthquake,
it will be a sign of historical progress if we find in the
book itself any allusions to the earthquake. Now these
are present. In the first division we find none, unless
the threat of God's visitation in the form of a shaking
of the land be considered as a tremor communicated
to the prophet's mind from the recent upheaval.
But in the second division there is an obvious reference:
the last of the unavailing chastisements, with which
Jehovah has chastised His people, is described as a
<i>great overturning</i>.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> And in the third division, in two
passages, the judgment, which Amos has already stated
will fall in the form of an invasion, is also figured in
the terms of an earthquake. Nor does this exhaust the
tremors which that awful convulsion had started; but
throughout the second and third divisions there is a
constant sense of instability, of the liftableness and
breakableness of the very ground of life. Of course, as
we shall see, this was due to the prophet's knowledge
of the moral explosiveness of society in Israel; but he
could hardly have described the results of that in the
terms he has used, unless himself and his hearers had
recently felt the ground quake under them, and seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
whole cities topple over. If, then, Amos began to
prophesy two years before the earthquake, the bulk of
his book was spoken, or at least written down, after the
earthquake had left all Israel trembling.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>This proof of progress in the book is confirmed by
another feature. In the abstract given above it is
easy to see that the judgments of the Lord upon Israel
were of a twofold character. Some were physical&mdash;famine,
drought, blight, locusts, earthquake; and some
were political&mdash;battle, defeat, invasion, captivity. Now
it is significant&mdash;and I do not think the point has been
previously remarked&mdash;that not only are the physical
represented as happening first, but that at one time
the prophet seems to have understood that no others
would be needed, that indeed God did not reveal to
him the imminence of political disaster till He had
exhausted the discipline of physical calamities. For
this we have double evidence. In chapter iv. Amos
reports that the Lord has sought to rouse Israel out
of the moral lethargy into which their religious services
have soothed them, by withholding bread and water;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
by blighting their orchards; by a pestilence, a thoroughly
Egyptian one; and by an earthquake. But these
having failed to produce repentance, God must visit the
people once more: how, the prophet does not say,
leaving the imminent terror unnamed, but we know
that the Assyrian overthrow is meant. Now precisely
parallel to this is the course of the Visions in chapter
vii. The Lord caused Amos to see (whether in fancy
or in fact we need not now stop to consider) the plague
of locusts. It was so bad as to threaten Israel with
destruction. But Amos interceded, and God answered,
<i>It shall not be</i>. Similarly with a plague of drought.
But then the Vision shifts from the realm of nature to
that of politics. The Lord sets the plumbline to the
fabric of Israel's life: this is found hopelessly bent and
unstable. It must be pulled down, and the pulling
down shall be political: the family of Jeroboam is to
be slain, the people are to go into captivity. The
next Vision, therefore, is of the End&mdash;the Final Judgment
of war and defeat, which is followed only by
Silence.</p>

<p>Thus, by a double proof, we see not only that the
Divine method in that age was to act first by physical
chastisement, and only then by an inevitable, ultimate
doom of war and captivity; but that the experience
of Amos himself, his own intercourse with the Lord,
passed through these two stages. The significance of
this for the picture of the prophet's life we shall see
in our next chapter. Here we are concerned to ask
whether it gives us any clue as to the extant arrangement
of his prophecies, or any justification for re-arranging
them, as the prophecies of Isaiah have to
be re-arranged, according to the various stages of
historical development at which they were uttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>We have just seen that the progress from the
physical chastisements to the political doom is reflected
in both the last two sections of the book. But the
same gradual, cumulative method is attributed to the
Divine Providence by the First Section: <i>for three
transgressions, yea, for four, I will not turn it back</i>; and
then follow the same disasters of war and captivity as
are threatened in Sections II. and III. But each
section does not only thus end similarly; each also
begins with the record of an immediate impression
made on the prophet by Jehovah (chaps. i. 2; iii.
3-8; vii. 1-9).</p>

<p>To sum up:&mdash;The Book of Amos consists of three
sections,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> which seem to have received their present
form towards the end of Jeroboam's reign; and which,
after emphasising their origin as due to the immediate
influence of Jehovah Himself on the prophet, follow
pretty much the same course of the Divine dealings with
that generation of Israel&mdash;a course which began with
physical chastisements, that failed to produce repentance,
and ended with the irrevocable threat of the
Assyrian invasion. Each section, that is to say, starts
from the same point, follows much the same direction,
and arrives at exactly the same conclusion. Chronologically
you cannot put one of them before the
other; but from each it is possible to learn the stages
of experience through which Amos himself passed&mdash;to
discover how God taught the prophet, not only by the
original intuitions from which all prophecy starts, but
by the gradual events of his day both at home and
abroad.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>This decides our plan for us. We shall first trace
the life and experience of Amos, as his book enables us
to do; and then we shall examine, in the order in
which they lie, the three parallel forms in which, when
he was silenced at Bethel, he collected the fruits of
that experience, and gave them their final expression.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The style of the book is simple and terse. The
fixity of the prophet's aim&mdash;upon a few moral principles
and the doom they demand&mdash;keeps his sentences firm
and sharp, and sends his paragraphs rapidly to their
climax. That he sees nature only under moral light
renders his poetry austere and occasionally savage.
His language is very pure. There is no ground for
Jerome's charge that he was "imperitus sermone": we
shall have to notice only a few irregularities in spelling,
due perhaps to the dialect of the deserts in which he
passed his life.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The text of the book is for the most part well-preserved;
but there are a number of evident corruptions.
Of the Greek Version the same holds good
as we have said in more detail of the Greek of Hosea.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
It is sometimes correct where the Hebrew text is not,
sometimes suggestive of the emendations required, and
sometimes hopelessly astray.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE MAN AND THE PROPHET</i></h3>


<p>The Book of Amos opens one of the greatest
stages in the religious development of mankind.
Its originality is due to a few simple ideas, which it
propels into religion with an almost unrelieved abruptness.
But, like all ideas which ever broke upon the
world, these also have flesh and blood behind them.
Like every other Reformation, this one in Israel began
with the conscience and the protest of an individual.
Our review of the book has made this plain. We have
found in it, not only a personal adventure of a heroic
kind, but a progressive series of visions, with some other
proofs of a development both of facts and ideas. In
short, behind the book there beats a life, and our first
duty is to attempt to trace its spiritual history. The
attempt is worth the greatest care. "Amos," says a
very critical writer,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> "is one of the most wonderful
appearances in the history of the human spirit."</p>


<h4>1. <span class="smcap">The Man and His Discipline.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> i. 1; iii. 3-8; vii. 14, 15.</h5>

<p>When charged at the crisis of his career with being
but a hireling-prophet, Amos disclaimed the official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
name and took his stand upon his work as a man: <i>No
prophet I, nor prophet's son, but a herdsman and a
dresser of sycomores. Jehovah took me from behind the
flock.</i><a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> We shall enhance our appreciation of this manhood,
and of the new order of prophecy which it
asserted, if we look for a little at the soil on which it
was so bravely nourished.</p>

<p>Six miles south from Bethlehem, as Bethlehem is six
from Jerusalem, there rises on the edge of the Judæan
plateau, towards the desert, a commanding hill, the
ruins on which are still known by the name of Te&#7731;ôa'.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>In the time of Amos Tekoa was a place without
sanctity and almost without tradition. The name suggests
that the site may at first have been that of a camp.
Its fortification by Rehoboam, and the mission of its
wise woman to David, are its only previous appearances
in history. Nor had nature been less grudging to it
than fame. The men of Tekoa looked out upon a
desolate and haggard world. South, west and north
the view is barred by a range of limestone hills, on one
of which directly north the grey towers of Jerusalem
are hardly to be discerned from the grey mountain
lines. Eastward the prospect is still more desolate, but
it is open; the land slopes away for nearly eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
miles to a depth of four thousand feet. Of this long
descent, the first step, lying immediately below the hill
of Tekoa, is a shelf of stony moorland with the ruins
of vineyards. It is the lowest ledge of the settled life
of Judæa. The eastern edge drops suddenly by broken
rocks to slopes spotted with bushes of "retem," the
broom of the desert, and with patches of poor wheat.
From the foot of the slopes the land rolls away in a
maze of low hills and shallow dales, that flush green in
spring, but for the rest of the year are brown with
withered grass and scrub. This is the <i>Wilderness</i> or
<i>Pastureland of Tekoa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> across which by night the wild
beasts howl, and by day the blackened sites of deserted
camps, with the loose cairns that mark the nomads'
graves, reveal a human life almost as vagabond and
nameless as that of the beasts. Beyond the rolling
land is Jeshimon, or Devastation&mdash;a chaos of hills,
none of whose ragged crests are tossed as high as the
shelf of Tekoa, while their flanks shudder down some
further thousands of feet, by crumbling precipices and
corries choked with debris, to the coast of the Dead
Sea. The northern half of this is visible, bright blue
against the red wall of Moab, and the level top of the
wall, broken only by the valley of the Arnon, constitutes
the horizon. Except for the blue water&mdash;which shines
in its gap between the torn hills like a bit of sky
through rifted clouds&mdash;it is a very dreary world. Yet
the sun breaks over it, perhaps all the more gloriously;
mists, rising from the sea simmering in its great vat,
drape the nakedness of the desert noon; and through
the dry desert night the planets ride with a majesty
they cannot assume in our more troubled atmospheres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
It is also a very empty and a very silent world, yet
every stir of life upon it excites, therefore, the greater
vigilance, and man's faculties, relieved from the rush
and confusion of events, form the instinct of marking,
and reflecting upon, every single phenomenon. And it
is a very savage world. Across it all, the towers of
Jerusalem give the only signal of the spirit, the one
token that man has a history.</p>

<p>Upon this unmitigated wilderness, where life is
reduced to poverty and danger; where nature starves
the imagination, but excites the faculties of perception
and curiosity; with the mountain tops and the sunrise
in his face, but above all with Jerusalem so near,&mdash;Amos
did the work which made him a man, heard the
voice of God calling him to be a prophet, and gathered
those symbols and figures in which his prophet's
message still reaches us with so fresh and so austere
an air.</p>

<p>Amos was <i>among the shepherds of Tekoa</i>. The word
for <i>shepherd</i> is unusual, and means the herdsman of a
peculiar breed of desert sheep, still under the same
name prized in Arabia for the excellence of their wool.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
And he was <i>a dresser of sycomores</i>. The tree, which
is not our sycamore, is very easily grown in sandy
soil with a little water. It reaches a great height and
mass of foliage. The fruit is like a small fig, with a
sweet but watery taste, and is eaten only by the poor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Born not of the fresh twigs, but of the trunk and older
branches, the sluggish lumps are provoked to ripen
by pinching or bruising, which seems to be the literal
meaning of the term that Amos uses of himself&mdash;<i>a
pincher of sycomores</i>.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The sycomore does not grow
at so high a level as Tekoa;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and this fact, taken along
with the limitation of the ministry of Amos to the
Northern Kingdom, has been held to prove that he
was originally an Ephraimite, a sycomore-dresser, who
had migrated and settled down, as the peculiar phrase
of the title says, <i>among the shepherds of Tekoa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> We
shall presently see, however, that his familiarity with
life in Northern Israel may easily have been won in
other ways than through citizenship in that kingdom;
while the very general nature of the definition, <i>among
the shepherds of Tekoa</i>, does not oblige us to place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
either him or his sycomores so high as the village
itself. The most easterly township of Judæa, Tekoa
commanded the whole of the wilderness beyond, to
which indeed it gave its name, <i>the wilderness of Tekoa</i>.
The shepherds of Tekoa were therefore, in all probability,
scattered across the whole region down to
the oases on the coast of the Dead Sea, which have
generally been owned by one or other of the settled
communities in the hill-country above, and may at
that time have belonged to Tekoa, just as in Crusading
times they belonged to the monks of Hebron, or are
to-day cultivated by the Rushaideh Arabs, who pitch
their camps not far from Tekoa itself. As you will
still find everywhere on the borders of the Syrian
desert shepherds nourishing a few fruit-trees round
the chief well of their pasture, in order to vary their
milk diet, so in some low oasis in the wilderness of
Judæa Amos cultivated the poorest, but the most
easily grown of fruits, the sycomore.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> All this pushes
Amos and his dwarf sheep deeper into the desert,
and emphasises what has been said above, and still
remains to be illustrated, of the desert's influence on
his discipline as a man and on his speech as a prophet.
We ought to remember that in the same desert
another prophet was bred, who was also the pioneer
of a new dispensation, and whose ministry, both in its
strength and its limitations, is much recalled by the
ministry of Amos. John the son of Zacharias <i>grew</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
<i>and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the
day of his showing unto Israel</i>.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Here, too, our Lord
was <i>with the wild beasts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> How much Amos had been
with them may be seen from many of his metaphors.
<i>The lion roareth, who shall not fear?... As when the
shepherd rescueth from the mouth of the lion two shin-bones
or a bit of an ear.... It shall be as when one
is fleeing from a lion, and a bear cometh upon him;
and he entereth a house, and leaneth his hand on the
wall, and a serpent biteth him.</i></p>

<p>As a wool-grower, however, Amos must have had
his yearly journeys among the markets of the land;
and to such were probably due his opportunities of
familiarity with Northern Israel, the originals of his
vivid pictures of her town-life, her commerce and the
worship at her great sanctuaries. One hour westward
from Tekoa would bring him to the high-road
between Hebron and the North, with its troops of
pilgrims passing to Beersheba.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> It was but half-an-hour
more to the watershed and an open view of the Philistine
plain. Bethlehem was only six, Jerusalem twelve
miles from Tekoa. Ten miles farther, across the
border of Israel, lay Bethel with its temple, seven
miles farther Gilgal, and twenty miles farther still
Samaria the capital, in all but two days' journey from
Tekoa. These had markets as well as shrines;<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
their annual festivals would be also great fairs. It
is certain that Amos visited them; it is even possible
that he went to Damascus, in which the Israelites had
at the time their own quarters for trading. By road
and market he would meet with men of other lands.
Ph&#339;nician pedlars, or Canaanites as they were called,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
came up to buy the homespun for which the housewives
of Israel were famed<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>&mdash;hard-faced men who were
also willing to purchase slaves, and haunted even the
battle-fields of their neighbours for this sinister purpose.
Men of Moab, at the time subject to Israel; Aramean
hostages; Philistines who held the export trade to
Egypt,&mdash;these Amos must have met and may have
talked with; their dialects scarcely differed from his
own. It is no distant, desert echo of life which we
hear in his pages, but the thick and noisy rumour of
caravan and market-place: how the plague was marching
up from Egypt;<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> ugly stories of the Ph&#339;nician
slave-trade;<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> rumours of the advance of the awful
Power, which men were hardly yet accustomed to name,
but which had already twice broken from the North
upon Damascus. Or it was the progress of some
national mourning&mdash;how lamentation sprang up in
the capital, rolled along the highways, and was re-echoed
from the husbandmen and vinedressers on the
hillsides.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Or, at closer quarters, we see and hear the
bustle of the great festivals and fairs&mdash;the <i>solemn
assemblies</i>, the reeking holocausts, the <i>noise of songs
and viols</i>;<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> the brutish religious zeal kindling into
drunkenness and lust on the very steps of the altar;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
the embezzlement of pledges by the priests, the
covetous restlessness of the traders, their false measures,
their entanglement of the poor in debt;<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> the careless
luxury of the rich, their <i>banquets</i>, <i>buckets of wine</i>, <i>ivory
couches</i>, pretentious, preposterous music.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> These things
are described as by an eyewitness. Amos was not a
citizen of the Northern Kingdom, to which he almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
exclusively refers; but it was because he went up and
down in it, using those eyes which the desert air had
sharpened, that he so thoroughly learned the wickedness
of its people, the corruption of Israel's life in every
rank and class of society.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>But the convictions which he applied to this life
Amos learned at home. They came to him over the
desert, and without further material signal than was
flashed to Tekoa from the towers of Jerusalem. This
is placed beyond doubt by the figures in which he
describes his call from Jehovah. Contrast his story,
so far as he reveals it, with that of another. Some
twenty years later, Isaiah of Jerusalem saw the Lord
in the Temple, high and lifted up, and all the inaugural
vision of this greatest of the prophets was conceived
in the figures of the Temple&mdash;the altar, the smoke,
the burning coals. But to his predecessor <i>among the
shepherds of Tekoa</i>, although revelation also starts from
Jerusalem, it reaches him, not in the sacraments of
her sanctuary, but across the bare pastures, and as it
were in the roar of a lion. <i>Jehovah from Zion roareth,
and uttereth His voice from Jerusalem.</i><a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> We read of
no formal process of consecration for this first of the
prophets. Through his clear desert air, the word of
God breaks upon him without medium or sacrament.
And the native vigilance of the man is startled, is
convinced by it, beyond all argument or question. <i>The
lion hath roared, who shall not fear? Jehovah hath
spoken, who can but prophesy?</i></p>

<p>These words are taken from a passage in which
Amos illustrates prophecy from other instances of his
shepherd life. We have seen what a school of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
vigilance the desert is. Upon the bare surface all
that stirs is ominous. Every shadow, every noise&mdash;the
shepherd must know what is behind and be
warned. Such a vigilance Amos would have Israel
apply to his own message, and to the events of their
history. Both of these he compares to certain facts
of desert life, behind which his shepherdly instincts
have taught him to feel an ominous cause. <i>Do two men
walk together except they have trysted?</i>&mdash;except they have
made an appointment. Hardly in the desert, for
there men meet and take the same road by chance as
seldom as ships at sea. <i>Doth a lion roar in the jungle
and have no prey, or a young lion let out his voice in his
den except he be taking something?</i> The hunting lion is
silent till his quarry be in sight; when the lonely shepherd
hears the roar across the desert, he knows the lion
leaps upon his prey, and he shudders as Israel ought
to do when they hear God's voice by the prophet,
for this also is never loosened but for some grim fact,
some leap of doom. Or <i>doth a little bird fall on the
snare earthwards and there be no noose upon her?</i> The
reading may be doubtful, but the meaning is obvious:
no one ever saw a bird pulled roughly down to earth
when it tried to fly away without knowing there was
the loop of a snare about her. Or <i>does the snare itself
rise up from the ground, except indeed it be capturing
something?</i>&mdash;except there be in the trap or net something
to flutter, struggle and so lift it up. Traps
do not move without life in them. Or <i>is the alarum
trumpet</i><a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> <i>blown in a city</i>&mdash;for instance, in high Tekoa
up there, when some Arab raid sweeps from the desert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
on to the fields&mdash;<i>and do the people not tremble?</i> Or
<i>shall calamity happen in a city and Jehovah not have
done it? Yea, the Lord Jehovah doeth nothing but He
has revealed His purpose to His servants the prophets.</i>
My voice of warning and these events of evil in your
midst have the same cause&mdash;Jehovah&mdash;behind them.
<i>The lion hath roared, who shall not fear? Jehovah hath
spoken, who can but prophesy?</i><a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>We cannot miss the personal note which rings
through this triumph in the reality of things unseen.
Not only does it proclaim a man of sincerity and conviction:
it is resonant with the discipline by which
that conviction was won&mdash;were won, too, the freedom
from illusion and the power of looking at facts in
the face, which Amos alone of his contemporaries
possessed.</p>

<p>St. Bernard has described the first stage of the
Vision of God as the Vision Distributive, in which
the eager mind distributes her attention upon common
things and common duties in themselves. It was in
this elementary school that the earliest of the new
prophets passed his apprenticeship and received his
gifts. Others excel Amos in the powers of the
imagination and the intellect. But by the incorrupt
habits of his shepherd's life, by daily wakefulness to
its alarms and daily faithfulness to its opportunities,
he was trained in that simple power of appreciating
facts and causes, which, applied to the great phenomena
of the spirit and of history, forms his distinction
among his peers. In this we find perhaps the reason
why he records of himself no solemn hour of cleansing
and initiation. <i>Jehovah took me from following the flock,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
<i>and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto My people
Israel.</i> Amos was of them of whom it is written,
"Blessed are those servants whom the Lord when He
cometh shall find watching." Through all his hard life,
this shepherd had kept his mind open and his conscience
quick, so that when the word of God came to him he
knew it, as fast as he knew the roar of the lion across
the moor. Certainly there is no habit, which, so much
as this of watching facts with a single eye and a
responsible mind, is indispensable alike in the humblest
duties and in the highest speculations of life. When
Amos gives those naïve illustrations of how real the
voice of God is to him, we receive them as the tokens
of a man, honest and awake. Little wonder that he
refuses to be reckoned among the professional prophets
of his day, who found their inspiration in excitement
and trance. Upon him the impulses of the Deity come
in no artificial and morbid ecstasy, removed as far as
possible from real life. They come upon him, as it
were, in the open air. They appeal to the senses of
his healthy and expert manhood. They convince him
of their reality with the same force as do the most
startling events of his lonely shepherd watches. <i>The
lion hath roared, who shall not fear? Jehovah hath
spoken, who can but prophesy?</i></p>

<p>The influence of the same discipline is still visible
when Amos passes from the facts of his own consciousness
to the facts of his people's life. His day in
Israel sweltered with optimism. The glare of wealth,
the fulsome love of country, the rank incense of a
religion that was without morality&mdash;these thickened
all the air, and neither the people nor their rulers had
any vision. But Amos carried with him his clear
desert atmosphere and his desert eyes. He saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
raw facts: the poverty, the cruel negligence of the rich,
the injustice of the rulers, the immorality of the priests.
The meaning of these things he questioned with as
much persistence as he questioned every suspicious
sound or sight upon those pastures of Tekoa. He had
no illusions: he knew a mirage when he saw one.
Neither the military pride of the people, fostered by
recent successes over Syria, nor the dogmas of their
religion, which asserted Jehovah's swift triumph upon
the heathen, could prevent him from knowing that the
immorality of Israel meant Israel's political downfall.
He was one of those recruits from common life, by
whom religion and the state have at all times been
reformed. Springing from the laity and very often
from among the working classes, their freedom from
dogmas and routine, as well as from the compromising
interests of wealth, rank and party, renders them
experts in life to a degree that almost no professional
priest, statesman or journalist, however honest or
sympathetic, can hope to rival. Into politics they
bring facts, but into religion they bring vision.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost significance that this reformer,
this founder of the highest order of prophecy in Israel,
should not only thus begin with facts, but to the very
end be occupied with almost nothing else, than the
vision and record of them. In Amos there is but
one prospect of the Ideal. It does not break till the
close of his book, and then in such contrast to the plain
and final indictments, which constitute nearly all the
rest of his prophesying, that many have not unnaturally
denied to him the verses which contain it.
Throughout the other chapters we have but the
exposure of present facts, material and moral, nor the
sight of any future more distant than to-morrow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the immediate consequences of to-day's deeds. Let
us mark this. The new prophecy which Amos started
in Israel reached Divine heights of hope, unfolded
infinite powers of moral and political regeneration&mdash;dared
to blot out all the past, dared to believe all things
possible in the future. But it started from the truth
about the moral situation of the present. Its first
prophet not only denied every popular dogma and
ideal, but appears not to have substituted for them
any others. He spent his gifts of vision on the discovery
and appreciation of facts. Now this is necessary,
not only in great reformations of religion, but
at almost every stage in her development. We are
constantly disposed to abuse even the most just and
necessary of religious ideals as substitutes for experience
or as escapes from duty, and to boast about the future
before we have understood or mastered the present.
Hence the need of realists like Amos. Though they
are destitute of dogma, of comfort, of hope, of the
ideal, let us not doubt that they also stand in the
succession of the prophets of the Lord.</p>

<p>Nay, this is a stage of prophecy on which may be
fulfilled the prayer of Moses: <i>Would to God that all
the Lord's people were prophets!</i> To see the truth and
tell it, to be accurate and brave about the moral
facts of our day&mdash;to this extent the Vision and the
Voice are possible for every one of us. Never for us
may the doors of heaven open, as they did for him
who stood on the threshold of the earthly temple,
and he saw the Lord enthroned, while the Seraphim
of the Presence sang the glory. Never for us may
the skies fill with that tempest of life which Ezekiel
beheld from Shinar, and above it the sapphire throne,
and on the throne the likeness of a man, the likeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of the glory of the Lord. Yet let us remember that
to see facts as they are and to tell the truth about
them&mdash;this also is prophecy. We may inhabit a sphere
which does not prompt the imagination, but is as
destitute of the historic and traditional as was the
wilderness of Tekoa. All the more may our unglamoured
eyes be true to the facts about us. Every
common day leads forth her duties as shining as every
night leads forth her stars. The deeds and the fortunes
of men are in our sight, and spell, to all who will
honestly read, the very Word of the Lord. If only
we be loyal, then by him who made the rude sounds
and sights of the desert his sacraments, and whose
vigilance of things seen and temporal became the
vision of things unseen and eternal, we also shall see
God, and be sure of His ways with men.</p>

<p>Before we pass from the desert discipline of the
prophet, we must notice one of its effects, which, while
it greatly enhanced the clearness of his vision, undoubtedly
disabled Amos for the highest prophetic
rank. He who lives in the desert lives without
patriotism&mdash;detached and aloof. He may see the
throng of men more clearly than those who move
among it. He cannot possibly so much feel for them.
Unlike Hosea, Isaiah and Jeremiah, Amos was not
a citizen of the kingdom against which he prophesied,
and indeed no proper citizen of any kingdom, but a
nomad herdsman, hovering on the desert borders of
Judæa. He saw Israel from the outside. His message
to her is achieved with scarcely one sob in his voice.
For the sake of the poor and the oppressed among
the people he is indignant. But with the erring,
staggering nation as a whole he has no real sympathy.
His pity for her is exhausted in one elegy and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
brief intercessions; hardly more than once does he even
call her to repentance. His sense of justice, in fact,
had almost never to contend with his love. This
made Amos the better witness, but the worse prophet.
He did not rise so high as his great successors, because
he did not so feel himself one with the people whom he
was forced to condemn, because he did not bear their fate
as his own nor travail for their new birth. "Ihm fehlt
die Liebe." Love is the element lacking in his prophecy;
and therefore the words are true of him, which were
uttered of his great follower across this same wilderness
of Judæa, that mighty as were his voice and his message
to prepare the way of the Lord, yet <i>the least in the
Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he</i>.</p>


<h4>2. <span class="smcap"><a id="The_Word_and_its_Origins"></a>The Word and its Origins.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> i. 2; iii. 3-8; and <i>passim</i>.</h5>

<p>We have seen the preparation of the Man for the
Word. We are now to ask, Whence came the Word
to the Man?&mdash;the Word that made him a prophet.
What were its sources and sanctions outside himself?
These involve other questions. How much of his
message did Amos inherit from the previous religion
of his people? And how much did he teach for the
first time in Israel? And again, how much of this
new element did he owe to the great events of his
day? And how much demands some other source of
inspiration?</p>

<p>To all these inquiries, outlines of the answers ought
by this time to have become visible. We have seen
that the contents of the Book of Amos consist almost
entirely of two kinds: facts, actual or imminent, in the
history of his people; and certain moral principles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the most elementary order. Amos appeals to no
dogma nor form of law, nor to any religious or national
institution. Still more remarkably, he does not rely
upon miracle nor any so-called "supernatural sign."
To employ the terms of Mazzini's famous formula,
Amos draws his materials solely from "conscience
and history." Within himself he hears certain moral
principles speak in the voice of God, and certain events
of his day he recognises as the judicial acts of God.
The principles condemn the living generation of Israel
as morally corrupt; the events threaten the people
with political extinction. From this agreement between
inward conviction and outward event Amos draws
his full confidence as a prophet, and enforces on the
people his message of doom as God's own word.</p>

<p>The passage in which Amos most explicitly illustrates
this harmony between event and conviction is one
whose metaphors we have already quoted in proof of
the desert's influence upon the prophet's life. When
Amos asks, <i>Can two walk together except they have made
an appointment?</i> his figure is drawn, as we have seen,
from the wilderness in which two men will hardly meet
except they have arranged to do so; but the truth, he
would illustrate by the figure, is that two sets of phenomena
which coincide must have sprung from a common
purpose. Their conjunction forbids mere chance.
What kind of phenomena he means, he lets us see in
his next instance: <i>Doth a lion roar in the jungle and
have no prey? Doth a young lion let forth his voice
from his den except he be catching something?</i> That is,
those ominous sounds never happen without some fell
and terrible deed happening along with them. Amos
thus plainly hints that the two phenomena on whose
coincidence he insists are an utterance on one side, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
on the other side a deed fraught with destruction. The
reading of the next metaphor about the bird and the
snare is uncertain; at most what it means is that
you never see signs of distress or a vain struggle to
escape without there being, though out of sight, some
real cause for them.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> But from so general a principle he
returns in his fourth metaphor to the special coincidence
between utterance and deed. <i>Is the alarum-trumpet
blown in a city and do the people not tremble?</i> Of course
they do; they know such sound is never made without
the approach of calamity. But who is the author of
every calamity? God Himself: <i>Shall there be evil in a
city and Jehovah not have done it?</i> Very well then; we
have seen that common life has many instances in
which, when an ominous sound is heard, it is because
it is closely linked with a fatal deed. These happen
together, not by mere chance, but because the one is
the expression, the warning or the explanation of the
other. And we also know that fatal deeds which
happen to any community in Israel are from Jehovah.
He is behind them. But they, too, are accompanied
by a warning voice from the same source as themselves.
This is the voice which the prophet hears in his heart&mdash;the
moral conviction which he feels as the Word of God.
<i>The Lord Jehovah doeth nothing but He hath revealed
His counsel to His servants the prophets.</i> Mark the
grammar: the revelation comes first to the prophet's
heart; then he sees and recognises the event, and is
confident to give his message about it. So Amos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
repeating his metaphor, sums up his argument. <i>The
Lion hath roared, who shall not fear?</i>&mdash;certain that
there is more than sound to happen. <i>The Lord Jehovah
hath spoken, who can but prophesy?</i>&mdash;certain that what
Jehovah has spoken to him inwardly is likewise no
mere sound, but that deeds of judgment are about to
happen, as the ominous voice requires they should.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>The prophet then is made sure of his message by the
agreement between the inward convictions of his soul
and the outward events of the day. When these walk
together, it proves that they have come of a common
purpose. He who causes the events&mdash;it is Jehovah
Himself, <i>for shall there be evil in a city and Jehovah not
have done it?</i>&mdash;must be author also of the inner voice
or conviction which agrees with them. <i>Who</i> then <i>can
but prophesy?</i> Observe again that no support is here
derived from miracle; nor is any claim made for the
prophet on the ground of his ability to foretell the
event. It is the agreement of the idea with the fact,
their evident common origin in the purpose of Jehovah,
which makes a man sure that he has in him the Word
of God. Both are necessary, and together are enough.
Are we then to leave the origin of the Word in this
coincidence of fact and thought&mdash;as it were an electric
flash produced by the contact of conviction with event?
Hardly: there are questions behind this coincidence.
For instance, as to how the two react on each other&mdash;the
event provoking the conviction, the conviction interpreting
the event? The argument of Amos seems
to imply that the ethical principles are experienced by
the prophet prior to the events which justify them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Is this so, or was the shock of the events required to
awaken the principles? And if the principles were
prior, whence did Amos derive them? These are
some questions that will lead us to the very origins of
revelation.</p>

<p>The greatest of the events with which Amos and his
contemporaries dealt was the Assyrian invasion. In
a previous chapter we have tried to estimate the intellectual
effects of Assyria on prophecy.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Assyria
widened the horizon of Israel, put the world to Hebrew
eyes into a new perspective, vastly increased the
possibilities of history and set to religion a novel order
of problems. We can trace the effects upon Israel's
conceptions of God, of man and even of nature.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Now
it might be plausibly argued that the new prophecy
in Israel was first stirred and quickened by all this
mental shock and strain, and that even the loftier ethics
of the prophets were thus due to the advance of Assyria.
For, as the most vigilant watchmen of their day, the
prophets observed the rise of that empire, and felt its
fatality for Israel. Turning then to inquire the Divine
reasons for such a destruction, they found these in
Israel's sinfulness, to the full extent of which their
hearts were at last awakened. According to such a
theory the prophets were politicians first and moralists
afterwards: alarmists to begin with, and preachers of
repentance only second. Or&mdash;to recur to the language
employed above&mdash;the prophets' experience of the
historical event preceded their conviction of the moral
principle which agreed with it.</p>

<p>In support of such a theory it is pointed out that
after all the most original element in the prophecy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the eighth century was the announcement of Israel's
fall and exile. The Righteousness of Jehovah had
often previously been enforced in Israel, but never
had any voice drawn from it this awful conclusion that
the nation must perish. The first in Israel to dare this
was Amos, and surely what enabled him to do so was
the imminence of Assyria upon his people. Again,
such a theory might plausibly point to the opening verse
of the Book of Amos, with its unprefaced, unexplained
pronouncement of doom upon Israel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The Lord roareth from Zion,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And giveth voice from Jerusalem;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And the pastures of the shepherds mourn,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And the summit of Carmel is withered!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here, it might be averred, is the earliest prophet's
earliest utterance. Is it not audibly the voice of a man
in a panic&mdash;such a panic as, ever on the eve of historic
convulsions, seizes the more sensitive minds of a
doomed people? The distant Assyrian thunder has
reached Amos, on his pastures, unprepared&mdash;unable to
articulate its exact meaning, and with only faith enough
to hear in it the voice of his God. He needs reflection
to unfold its contents; and the process of this
reflection we find through the rest of his book. There
he details for us, with increasing clearness, both the
ethical reasons and the political results of that Assyrian
terror, by which he was at first so wildly shocked into
prophecy.</p>

<p>But the panic-born are always the still-born; and it
is simply impossible that prophecy, in all her ethical
and religious vigour, can have been the daughter of so
fatal a birth. If we look again at the evidence which
is quoted from Amos in favour of such a theory, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
shall see how fully it is contradicted by other features
of his book.</p>

<p>To begin with, we are not certain that the terror of
the opening verse of Amos is the Assyrian terror. Even
if it were, the opening of a book does not necessarily
represent the writer's earliest feelings. The rest of the
chapters contain visions and oracles which obviously
date from a time when Amos was not yet startled by
Assyria, but believed that the punishment which Israel
required might be accomplished through a series of
physical calamities&mdash;locusts, drought and pestilence.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
Nay, it was not even these earlier judgments, preceding
the Assyrian, which stirred the word of God in the
prophet. He introduces them with a <i>now</i> and a
<i>therefore</i>. That is to say, he treats them only as the
consequence of certain facts, the conclusion of certain
premises. These facts and premises are moral&mdash;they
are exclusively moral. They are the sins of Israel's
life, regarded without illusion and without pity. They
are certain simple convictions, which fill the prophet's
heart, about the impossibility of the survival of any
state which is so perverse and so corrupt.</p>

<p>This origin of prophecy in moral facts and moral
intuitions, which are in their beginning independent of
political events, may be illustrated by several other
points. For instance, the sins which Amos marked in
Israel were such as required no "red dawn of judgment"
to expose their flagrance and fatality. The
abuse of justice, the cruelty of the rich, the shameless
immorality of the priests, are not sins which we feel only
in the cool of the day, when God Himself draws near
to judgment. They are such things as make men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
shiver in the sunshine. And so the Book of Amos,
and not less that of Hosea, tremble with the feeling
that Israel's social corruption is great enough of itself,
without the aid of natural convulsions, to shake the
very basis of national life. <i>Shall not the land tremble
for this</i>, Amos says after reciting some sins, <i>and
every one that dwelleth therein</i>?<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Not drought nor pestilence
nor invasion is needed for Israel's doom, but the
elemental force of ruin which lies in the people's own
wickedness. This is enough to create gloom long
before the political skies be overcast&mdash;or, as Amos
himself puts it, this is enough</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>To cause the sun to go down at noon,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And to darken the earth in the clear day.</i><a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And once more&mdash;in spite of Assyria the ruin may be
averted, if only the people will repent: <i>Seek good and
not evil, and Jehovah of hosts will be with you, as you
say</i>.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Assyria, however threatening, becomes irrelevant
to Israel's future from the moment that Israel repents.</p>

<p>Such beliefs, then, are obviously not the results of
experience, nor of a keen observation of history.
They are the primal convictions of the heart, which are
deeper than all experience, and themselves contain the
sources of historical foresight. With Amos it was not
the outward event which inspired the inward conviction,
but the conviction which anticipated and interpreted
the event, though when the event came there can be
no doubt that it confirmed, deepened, and articulated
the conviction.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>But when we have thus tracked the stream of
prophecy as far back as these elementary convictions
we have not reached the fountain-head. Whence did
Amos derive his simple and absolute ethics? Were
they original to him? Were they new in Israel?
Such questions start an argument which touches the
very origins of revelation.</p>

<p>It is obvious that Amos not only takes for granted
the laws of righteousness which he enforces: he takes
for granted also the people's conscience of them. New,
indeed, is the doom which sinful Israel deserves, and
original to himself is the proclamation of it; but Amos
appeals to the moral principles which justify the doom,
as if they were not new, and as if Israel ought always
to have known them. This attitude of the prophet
to his principles has, in our time, suffered a curious
judgment. It has been called an anachronism. So
absolute a morality, some say, had never before been
taught in Israel; nor had righteousness been so exclusively
emphasised as the purpose of Jehovah. Amos
and the other prophets of his century were the virtual
"creators of ethical monotheism": it could only be
by a prophetic licence or prophetic fiction that he appealed
to his people's conscience of the standards he
promulgated, or condemned his generation to death
for not having lived up to them.</p>

<p>Let us see how far this criticism is supported by
the facts.</p>

<p>To no sane observer can the religious history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Israel appear as anything but a course of gradual
development. Even in the moral standards, in respect
to which it is confessedly often most difficult to prove
growth, the signs of the nation's progress are very
manifest. Practices come to be forbidden in Israel
and tempers to be mitigated, which in earlier ages were
sanctioned to their extreme by the explicit decrees of
religion. In the nation's attitude to the outer world
sympathies arise, along with ideals of spiritual service,
where previously only war and extermination had been
enforced in the name of the Deity. Now in such an
evolution it is equally indubitable that the longest and
most rapid stage was the prophecy of the eighth
century. The prophets of that time condemn acts which
had been inspired by their immediate predecessors;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
they abjure, as impeding morality, a ceremonial which
the spiritual leaders of earlier generations had felt
to be indispensable to religion; and they unfold ideals
of the nation's moral destiny, of which older writings
give us only the faintest hints. Yet, while the fact
of a religious evolution in Israel is thus certain, we
must not fall into the vulgar error which interprets
evolution as if it were mere addition, nor forget that
even in the most creative periods of religion nothing
is brought forth which has not already been promised,
and, at some earlier stage, placed, so to speak, within
reach of the human mind. After all it is the mind
which grows; the moral ideals which become visible
to its more matured vision are so Divine that, when
they present themselves, the mind cannot but think
they were always real and always imperative. If we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
remember these commonplaces we shall do justice both
to Amos and to his critics.</p>

<p>In the first place it is clear that most of the morality
which Amos enforced is of that fundamental order
which can never have been recognised as the discovery
or invention of any prophet. Whatever be their origin,
the conscience of justice, the duty of kindness to the
poor, the horror of wanton cruelty towards one's enemies,
which form the chief principles of Amos, are discernible
in man as far back as history allows us to search for
them. Should a generation have lost them, they can
be brought back to it, never with the thrill of a new
lesson, but only with the shame of an old and an
abused memory. To neither man nor people can the
righteousness which Amos preached appear as a discovery,
but always as a recollection and a remorse.
And this is most emphatically true of the people of
Moses and of Samuel, of Nathan, of Elijah and of
the Book of the Covenant. Ethical elements had been
characteristic of Israel's religion from the very first.
They were not due to a body of written law, but rather
to the character of Israel's God, appreciated by the
nation in all the great crises of their history.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Jehovah
had won for Israel freedom and unity. He had been
a spirit of justice to their lawgivers and magistrates.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
He had raised up a succession of consecrated personalities,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
who by life and word had purified the ideals
of the whole people. The results had appeared in
the creation of a strong national conscience, which
avenged with horror, as <i>folly in Israel</i>, the wanton
crimes of any person or section of the commonwealth;
in the gradual formation of a legal code, founded indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in the common custom of the Semites, but greatly more
moral than that; and even in the attainment of certain
profoundly ethical beliefs about God and His relations,
beyond Israel, to all mankind. Now, let us understand
once for all, that in the ethics of Amos there is nothing
which is not rooted in one or other of these achievements
of the previous religion of his people. To
this religion Amos felt himself attached in the closest
possible way. The word of God comes to him across
the desert, as we have seen, yet not out of the air.
From the first he hears it rise from that one monument
of his people's past which we have found visible on
his physical horizon<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>&mdash;<i>from Zion</i>, <i>from Jerusalem</i>,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
from the city of David, from the Ark, whose ministers
were Moses and Samuel, from the repository of the
main tradition of Israel's religion.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Amos felt himself
in the sacred succession; and his feeling is confirmed
by the contents of his book. The details of that civic
justice which he demands from his generation are found
in the Book of the Covenant&mdash;the only one of Israel's
great codes which appears by this time to have been
in existence;<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> or in those popular proverbs which
almost as certainly were found in early Israel.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor does Amos go elsewhere for the religious sanctions
of his ethics. It is by the ancient mercies of
God towards Israel that he shames and convicts his
generation&mdash;by the deeds of grace which made them a
nation, by the organs of doctrine and reproof which have
inspired them, unfailing from age to age. <i>I destroyed
the Amorite before them.... Yea, I brought you up out
of the land of Egypt, and I led you forty years in the
wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorites. And I
raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men
for Nazirites. Was it not even thus, O ye children of
Israel? saith Jehovah.</i><a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> We cannot even say that the
belief which Amos expresses in Jehovah as the supreme
Providence of the world<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> was a new thing in Israel,
for a belief as universal inspires those portions of
the Book of Genesis which, like the Book of the
Covenant, were already extant.</p>

<p>We see, therefore, what right Amos had to present
his ethical truths to Israel, as if they were not new, but
had been within reach of his people from of old.</p>

<p>We could not, however, commit a greater mistake,
than to confine the inspiration of our prophet to the
past, and interpret his doctrines as mere inferences
from the earlier religious ideas of Israel&mdash;inferences
forced by his own passionate logic, or more naturally
ripened for him by the progress of events. A recent
writer has thus summarised the work of the prophets
of the eighth century: "In fact they laid hold upon
that bias towards the ethical, which dwelt in Jahwism
from Moses onwards, and they allowed it alone to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
value as corresponding to the true religion of Jehovah."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
But this is too abstract to be an adequate statement
of the prophets' own consciousness. What overcame
Amos was a Personal Influence&mdash;the Impression of a
Character; and it was this not only as it was revealed
in the past of his people. The God who stands behind
Amos is indeed the ancient Deity of Israel, and the
facts which prove Him God are those which made the
nation&mdash;the Exodus, the guidance through the wilderness,
the overthrow of the Amorites, the gift of the
land. <i>Was it not even thus, O ye children of Israel?</i>
But what beats and burns through the pages of
Amos is not the memory of those wonderful works,
so much as a fresh vision and understanding of the
Living God who worked them. Amos has himself
met with Jehovah on the conditions of his own time&mdash;on
the moral situation provided by the living generation
of Israel. By an intercourse conducted, not
through the distant signals of the past, but here and
now, through the events of the prophet's own day,
Amos has received an original and overpowering conviction
of his people's God as absolute righteousness.
What prophecy had hitherto felt in part, and applied
to one or other of the departments of Israel's life,
Amos is the first to feel in its fulness, and to every
extreme of its consequences upon the worship, the
conduct and the fortunes of the nation. To him
Jehovah not only commands this and that righteous
law, but Jehovah and righteousness are absolutely
identical. <i>Seek Jehovah and ye shall live ... seek good
and ye shall live.</i><a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The absoluteness with which Amos
conceived this principle, the courage with which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
applied it, carry him along those two great lines upon
which we most clearly trace his originality as a prophet.
In the strength of this principle he does what is really
new in Israel: he discards the two elements which had
hitherto existed alongside the ethical, and had fettered
and warped it.</p>

<p>Up till now the ethical spirit of the religion of
Jehovah<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> had to struggle with two beliefs which we can
trace back to the Semitic origins of the religion&mdash;the
belief, namely, that, as the national God, Jehovah would
always defend their political interests, irrespective of
morality; and the belief that a ceremonial of rites and
sacrifices was indispensable to religion. These principles
were mutual: as the deity was bound to succour
the people, so were the people bound to supply the
deity with gifts, and the more of these they brought
the more they made sure of his favours. Such views
were not absolutely devoid of moral benefit. In the
formative period of the nation they had contributed
both discipline and hope. But of late they had between
them engrossed men's hearts, and crushed out
of religion both conscience and common-sense. By the
first of them, the belief in Jehovah's predestined protection
of Israel, the people's eyes were so holden they
could not see how threatening were the times; by the
other, the confidence in ceremonial, conscience was
dulled, and that immorality permitted which they
mingled so shamelessly with their religious zeal. Now
the conscience of Amos did not merely protest against
the predominance of the two, but was so exclusive, so
spiritual, that it boldly banished both from religion.
Amos denied that Jehovah was bound to save His people;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
he affirmed that ritual and sacrifice were no part of the
service He demands from men. This is the measure
of originality in our prophet. The two religious principles
which were inherent in the very fibre of Semitic
religion, and which till now had gone unchallenged in
Israel, Amos cast forth from religion in the name of
a pure and absolute righteousness. On the one hand,
Jehovah's peculiar connection with Israel meant no more
than jealousy for their holiness: <i>You only have I known
of all the families of the earth, therefore will I visit upon
you all your iniquities.</i><a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> And, on the other hand, all their
ceremonial was abhorrent to Him: <i>I hate, I despise
your festivals.... Though ye offer Me burnt offerings and
your meal offerings, I will not accept them.... Take thou
away from Me the noise of thy songs; I will not hear
the music of thy viols. But let justice run down as
waters, and righteousness as a perennial stream.</i><a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>It has just been said that emphasis upon morality as
the sum of religion, to the exclusion of sacrifice, is the
most original element in the prophecies of Amos. He
himself, however, does not regard this as proclaimed
for the first time in Israel, and the precedent he quotes
is so illustrative of the sources of his inspiration that
we do well to look at it for a little. In the verse next
to the one last quoted he reports these words of God:
<i>Did ye offer unto Me sacrifices and gifts in the wilderness,
for forty years, O house of Israel?</i> An extraordinary
challenge! From the present blind routine of sacrifice
Jehovah appeals to the beginning of His relations with
the nation: did they then perform such services to
Him? Of course, a negative answer is expected. No
other agrees with the main contention of the passage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
In the wilderness Israel had not offered sacrifices and
gifts to Jehovah. Jeremiah quotes a still more explicit
word of Jehovah: <i>I spake not unto your fathers in the
day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning
burnt offerings and sacrifices: but this thing I
commanded them, saying, Obey My voice, and I will be
your God, and ye shall be My people.</i><a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>To these Divine statements we shall not be able to
do justice if we hold by the traditional view that the
Levitical legislation was proclaimed in the wilderness.
Discount that legislation, and the statements become
clear. It is true, of course, that Israel must have had
a ritual of some kind from the first; and that both in
the wilderness and in Canaan their spiritual leaders
must have performed sacrifices as if these were acceptable
to Jehovah. But even so the Divine words
which Amos and Jeremiah quote are historically correct;
for while the ethical contents of the religion
of Jehovah were its original and essential contents&mdash;<i>I
commanded them, saying, Obey My voice</i>&mdash;the ritual
was but a modification of the ritual common to all
Semites; and ever since the occupation of the land,
it had, through the infection of the Canaanite rites on
the high places, grown more and more Pagan, both
in its functions and in the ideas which these were supposed
to express.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Amos was right. Sacrifice had
never been the Divine, the revealed element in the
religion of Jehovah. Nevertheless, before Amos no
prophet in Israel appears to have said so. And what
enabled this man in the eighth century to offer testimony,
so novel but so true, about the far-away beginnings
of his people's religion in the fourteenth, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
plainly neither tradition nor historical research, but an
overwhelming conviction of the spiritual and moral
character of God&mdash;of Him who had been Israel's God
both then and now, and whose righteousness had been,
just as much then as now, exalted above all purely
national interests and all susceptibility to ritual. When
we thus see the prophet's knowledge of the Living
God enabling him, not only to proclaim an ideal of
religion more spiritual than Israel had yet dreamed,
but to perceive that such an ideal had been the essence
of the religion of Jehovah from the first, we understand
how thoroughly Amos was mastered by that
knowledge. If we need any further proof of his
"possession" by the character of God, we find it in
those phrases in which his own consciousness disappears,
and we have no longer the herald's report of
the Lord's words, but the very accents of the Lord Himself,
fraught with personal feeling of the most intense
quality. <i>I</i> Jehovah <i>hate, I despise your feast days....
Take thou away from Me the noise of thy songs; I
will not hear the music of thy viols.</i><a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>... <i>I abhor the
arrogance of Jacob, and hate his palaces.</i><a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>... <i>The eyes
of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom.</i><a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>...
<i>Jehovah sweareth, I will never forget any of their works.</i><a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
Such sentences reveal a Deity who is not only manifest
Character, but surgent and importunate Feeling.
We have traced the prophet's word to its ultimate source.
It springs from the righteousness, the vigilance, the
urgency of the Eternal. The intellect, imagination
and heart of Amos&mdash;the convictions he has inherited
from his people's past, his conscience of their evil life
to-day, his impressions of current and coming history&mdash;are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
all enforced and illuminated, all made impetuous
and radiant, by the Spirit, that is to say the Purpose
and the Energy, of the Living God. Therefore, as he
says in the title of his book, or as some one says for
him, Amos <i>saw</i> his words. They stood out objective
to himself. And they were not mere sound. They
glowed and burned with God.</p>

<p>When we realise this, we feel how inadequate it is
to express prophecy in the terms of evolution. No
doubt, as we have seen, the ethics and religion of Amos
represent a large and measurable advance upon those
of earlier Israel. And yet with Amos we do not seem
so much to have arrived at a new stage in a Process, as
to have penetrated to the Idea which has been behind
the Process from the beginning. The change and
growth of Israel's religion are realities&mdash;their fruits can
be seen, defined, catalogued&mdash;but a greater reality is
the unseen Purpose which impels them. They have
been expressed only now. He has been unchanging
from old and for ever&mdash;from the first absolute righteousness
in Himself, and absolute righteousness in His
demands from men.</p>


<h4>3. <span class="smcap"><a id="The_Prophet_and_his_Ministry"></a>The Prophet and his Ministry.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> vii., viii. 1-4.</h5>

<p>We have seen the preparation of the Man for the
Word; we have sought to trace to its source the Word
which came to the Man. It now remains for us to
follow the Prophet, Man and Word combined, upon
his Ministry to the people.</p>

<p>For reasons given in a previous chapter,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> there must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
always be some doubt as to the actual course of the
ministry of Amos before his appearance at Bethel.
Most authorities, however, agree that the visions recounted
in the beginning of the seventh chapter form
the substance of his address at Bethel, which was
interrupted by the priest Amaziah. These visions
furnish a probable summary of the prophet's experience
up to that point. While they follow the same course,
which we trace in the two series of oracles that now
precede them in the book, the ideas in them are less
elaborate. At the same time it is evident that Amos
must have already spoken upon other points than those
which he puts into the first three visions. For instance,
Amaziah reports to the king that Amos had explicitly
predicted the exile of the whole people<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>&mdash;a conviction
which, as we have seen, the prophet reached only
after some length of experience. It is equally certain
that Amos must have already exposed the sins of the
people in the light of the Divine righteousness. Some
of the sections of the book which deal with this subject
appear to have been originally spoken; and it is unnatural
to suppose that the prophet announced the
chastisements of God without having previously justified
these to the consciences of men.</p>

<p>If this view be correct, Amos, having preached for
some time to Israel concerning the evil state of society,
appeared at a great religious festival in Bethel,
determined to bring matters to a crisis, and to announce
the doom which his preaching threatened and
the people's continued impenitence made inevitable.
Mark his choice of place and of audience. It was no
mere king he aimed at. Nathan had dealt with David,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Gad with Solomon, Elijah with Ahab and Jezebel. But
Amos sought the people, them with whom resided the
real forces and responsibilities of life: the wealth, the
social fashions, the treatment of the poor, the spirit of
worship, the ideals of religion.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> And Amos sought
the people upon what was not only a great popular
occasion, but one on which was arrayed, in all pomp
and lavishness, the very system he essayed to overthrow.
The religion of his time&mdash;religion as mere
ritual and sacrifice&mdash;was what God had sent him to
beat down, and he faced it at its headquarters, and
upon one of its high days, in the royal and popular
sanctuary where it enjoyed at once the patronage
of the crown, the lavish gifts of the rich and the
thronged devotion of the multitude. As Savonarola at
the Duomo in Florence, as Luther at the Diet of Worms,
as our Lord Himself at the feast in Jerusalem, so was
Amos at the feast in Bethel. Perhaps he was still
more lonely. He speaks nowhere of having made a
disciple, and in the sea of faces which turned on him
when he spoke, it is probable that he could not welcome
a single ally. They were officials, or interested
traders, or devotees; he was a foreigner and a wild
man, with a word that spared the popular dogma as
little as the royal prerogative. Well for him was it
that over all those serried ranks of authority, those
fanatic crowds, that lavish splendour, another vision
commanded his eyes. <i>I saw the Lord standing over
the altar, and He said, Smite.</i></p>

<p>Amos told the pilgrims at Bethel that the first events
of his time in which he felt a purpose of God in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
harmony with his convictions about Israel's need of
punishment were certain calamities of a physical kind.
Of these, which in chapter iv. he describes as successively
drought, blasting, locusts, pestilence and earthquake,
he selected at Bethel only two&mdash;locusts and
drought&mdash;and he began with the locusts. It may have
been either the same visitation as he specifies in
chapter iv., or a previous one; for of all the plagues
of Palestine locusts have been the most frequent,
occurring every six or seven years. <i>Thus the Lord
Jehovah caused me to see: and, behold, a brood</i><a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> <i>of locusts
at the beginning of the coming up of the spring crops.</i> In
the Syrian year there are practically two tides of
verdure: one which starts after the early rains of
October and continues through the winter, checked by
the cold; and one which comes away with greater force
under the influence of the latter rains and more genial
airs of spring.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Of these it was the later and richer
which the locusts had attacked. <i>And, behold, it was
after the king's mowings.</i> These seem to have been
a tribute which the kings of Israel levied on the spring
herbage, and which the Roman governors of Syria used
annually to impose in the month Nisan.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> <i>After the
king's mowings</i> would be a phrase to mark the time
when everybody else might turn to reap their green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
stuff. It was thus the very crisis of the year when
the locusts appeared; the April crops devoured, there
was no hope of further fodder till December. Still,
the calamity had happened before, and had been survived;
a nation so vigorous and wealthy as Israel was
under Jeroboam II. need not have been frightened
to death. But Amos felt it with a conscience. To
him it was the beginning of that destruction of his
people which the spirit within him knew that their sin
had earned. So <i>it came to pass, when</i> the locusts <i>had
made an end of devouring the verdure of the earth, that
I said, Remit, I pray Thee,</i> or <i>pardon</i>&mdash;a proof that there
already weighed on the prophet's spirit something more
awful than loss of grass&mdash;<i>how shall Jacob rise again?
for he is little</i>.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The prayer was heard. <i>Jehovah repented
for this: It shall not be, said Jehovah.</i> The
unnameable <i>it</i> must be the same as in the frequent
phrase of the first chapter: <i>I will not turn It back</i>&mdash;namely,
the final execution of doom on the people's sin.
The reserve with which this is mentioned, both while
there is still chance for the people to repent and after
it has become irrevocable, is very impressive.</p>

<p>The next example which Amos gave at Bethel of
his permitted insight into God's purpose was a great
drought. <i>Thus the Lord Jehovah made me to see: and,
behold, the Lord Jehovah was calling fire into the quarrel.</i><a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
There was, then, already a quarrel between Jehovah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and His people&mdash;another sign that the prophet's moral
conviction of Israel's sin preceded the rise of the events
in which he recognised its punishment. <i>And</i> the fire
<i>devoured the Great Deep, yea, it was about to devour the
land</i>.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Severe drought in Palestine might well be
described as fire, even when it was not accompanied
by the flame and smoke of those forest and prairie fires
which Joel describes as its consequences.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> But to have
the full fear of such a drought, we should need to
feel beneath us the curious world which the men of
those days felt. To them the earth rested in a great
deep, from whose stores all her springs and fountains
burst. When these failed it meant that the unfathomed
floods below were burnt up. But how fierce the flame
that could effect this! And how certainly able to
devour next the solid land which rested above the deep&mdash;the
very <i>Portion</i><a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> assigned by God to His people.
Again Amos interceded: <i>Lord Jehovah, I pray Thee forbear:
how shall Jacob rise? for he is little.</i> And for
the second time Jacob was reprieved. <i>Jehovah repented
for this: It also shall not come to pass, said the Lord
Jehovah.</i></p>

<p>We have treated these visions, not as the imagination
or prospect of possible disasters,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> but as insight into
the meaning of actual plagues. Such a treatment is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
justified, not only by the invariable habit of Amos to
deal with real facts, but also by the occurrence of
these same plagues among the series by which, as we
are told, God had already sought to move the people
to repentance.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The general question of sympathy
between such purely physical disasters and the moral
evil of a people we may postpone to another chapter,
confining ourselves here to the part played in the
events by the prophet himself.</p>

<p>Surely there is something wonderful in the attitude
of this shepherd to the fires and plagues that Nature
sweeps upon his land. He is ready for them. And he
is ready not only by the general feeling of his time that
such things happen of the wrath of God. His sovereign
and predictive conscience recognises them as her
ministers. They are sent to punish a people whom
she has already condemned. Yet, unlike Elijah, Amos
does not summon the drought, nor even welcome its
arrival. How far has prophecy travelled since the
violent Tishbite! With all his conscience of Israel's
sin, Amos yet prays that their doom may be turned.
We have here some evidence of the struggle through
which these later prophets passed, before they accepted
their awful messages to men. Even Amos, desert-bred
and living aloof from Israel, shrank from the judgment
which it was his call to publish. For two moments&mdash;they
would appear to be the only two in his ministry&mdash;his
heart contended with his conscience, and twice he
entreated God to forgive. At Bethel he told the people
all this, in order to show how unwillingly he took up
his duty against them, and how inevitable he found
that duty to be. But still more shall we learn from his
tale, if we feel in his words about the smallness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Jacob, not pity only, but sympathy. We shall learn
that prophets are never made solely by the bare word
of God, but that even the most objective and judicial
of them has to earn his title to proclaim judgment
by suffering with men the agony of the judgment he
proclaims. Never to a people came there a true
prophet who had not first prayed for them. To have
entreated for men, to have represented them in the
highest courts of Being, is to have deserved also supreme
judicial rights upon them. And thus it is that our
Judge at the Last Day shall be none other than our
great Advocate who continually maketh intercession
for us. It is prayer, let us repeat, which, while it gives
us all power with God, endows us at the same time
with moral rights over men. Upon his mission of
judgment we shall follow Amos with the greater
sympathy that he thus comes forth to it from the
mercy-seat and the ministry of intercession.</p>

<p>The first two visions which Amos told at Bethel
were of disasters in the sphere of nature, but his third
lay in the sphere of politics. The two former were, in
their completeness at least, averted; and the language
Amos used of them seems to imply that he had not
even then faced the possibility of a final overthrow.
He took for granted <i>Jacob</i> was <i>to rise again</i>: he only
feared as to <i>how</i> this should be. But the third vision
is so final that the prophet does not even try to intercede.
Israel is measured, found wanting and doomed. Assyria
is not named, but is obviously intended; and the fact
that the prophet arrives at certainty with regard to the
doom of Israel, just when he thus comes within sight
of Assyria, is instructive as to the influence exerted on
prophecy by the rise of that empire.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Thus He gave me to see: and, behold, the Lord had
taken His station</i>&mdash;'tis a more solemn word than the
<i>stood</i> of our versions&mdash;<i>upon a city wall</i> built to <i>the
plummet,</i><a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> <i>and in His hand a plummet. And Jehovah
said unto me, What art thou seeing, Amos?</i> The
question surely betrays some astonishment shown by
the prophet at the vision or some difficulty he felt in
making it out. He evidently does not feel it at once,
as the natural result of his own thinking: it is objective
and strange to him; he needs time to see into it. <i>And
I said, A plummet. And the Lord said, Behold, I am
setting a plummet in the midst of My people Israel. I
will not again pass them over.</i> To set a measuring line
or a line with weights attached to any building means
to devote it to destruction;<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> but here it is uncertain
whether the plummet threatens destruction, or means
that Jehovah will at last clearly prove to the prophet
the insufferable obliquity of the fabric of the nation's life,
originally set straight by Himself&mdash;originally <i>a wall of a
plummet</i>. For God's judgments are never arbitrary: by a
standard we men can read He shows us their necessity.
Conscience itself is no mere voice of authority: it
is a convincing plummet, and plainly lets us see <i>why</i>
we should be punished. But whichever interpretation
we choose, the result is the same. <i>The high places of
Israel shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Isaac laid
waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with
the sword.</i> A declaration of war! Israel is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
invaded, her dynasty overthrown. Every one who
heard the prophet would know, though he named them
not, that the Assyrians were meant.</p>

<p>It was apparently at this point that Amos was
interrupted by Amaziah. The priest, who was conscious
of no spiritual power with which to oppose the
prophet, gladly grasped the opportunity afforded him by
the mention of the king, and fell back on the invariable
resource of a barren and envious sacerdotalism: <i>He
speaketh against Cæsar.</i><a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> There follows one of the
great scenes of history&mdash;the scene which, however fast
the ages and the languages, the ideals and the deities
may change, repeats itself with the same two actors.
Priest and Man face each other&mdash;Priest with King
behind, Man with God&mdash;and wage that debate in which
the whole warfare and progress of religion consist.
But the story is only typical by being real. Many
subtle traits of human nature prove that we have here
an exact narrative of fact. Take Amaziah's report to
Jeroboam. He gives to the words of the prophet just
that exaggeration and innuendo which betray the wily
courtier, who knows how to accentuate a general denunciation
till it feels like a personal attack. And yet, like
every Caiaphas of his tribe, the priest in his exaggerations
expresses a deeper meaning than he is conscious
of. <i>Amos</i>&mdash;note how the mere mention of the name
without description proves that the prophet was already
known in Israel, perhaps was one on whom the authorities
had long kept their eye&mdash;<i>Amos hath conspired
against thee</i>&mdash;yet God was his only fellow-conspirator!&mdash;<i>in
the midst of the house of Israel</i>&mdash;this royal temple
at Bethel. <i>The land is not able to hold his words</i>&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
must burst; yes, but in another sense than thou
meanest, O Caiaphas-Amaziah! <i>For thus hath Amos
said, By the sword shall Jeroboam die</i>&mdash;Amos had
spoken only of the dynasty, but the twist which
Amaziah lends to the words is calculated&mdash;<i>and Israel
going shall go into captivity from off his own land</i>.
This was the one unvarnished spot in the report.</p>

<p>Having fortified himself, as little men will do, by
his duty to the powers that be, Amaziah dares to turn
upon the prophet; and he does so, it is amusing to
observe, with that tone of intellectual and moral superiority
which it is extraordinary to see some men
derive from a merely official station or touch with
royalty. <i>Visionary,</i><a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> <i>begone! Get thee off to the land of
Judah; and earn</i><a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> <i>thy bread there, and there play the
prophet. But at Bethel</i>&mdash;mark the rising accent of the
voice&mdash;<i>thou shalt not again prophesy. The King's Sanctuary
it is, and the House of the Kingdom.</i><a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> With the
official mind this is more conclusive than that it is the
House of God! In fact the speech of Amaziah justifies
the hardest terms which Amos uses of the religion of
his day. In all this priest says there is no trace of the
spiritual&mdash;only fear, pride and privilege. Divine truth
is challenged by human law, and the Word of God
silenced in the name of the king.</p>

<p>We have here a conception of religion, which is not
merely due to the unspiritual character of the priest
who utters it, but has its roots in the far back origins
of Israel's religion. The Pagan Semite identified absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
State and Church; and on that identification was
based the religious practice of early Israel. It had
many healthy results: it kept religion in touch with
public life; order, justice, patriotism, self-sacrifice for
the common weal, were devoutly held to be matters of
religion. So long, therefore, as the system was inspired
by truly spiritual ideals, nothing for those times could
be better. But we see in it an almost inevitable
tendency to harden to the sheerest officialism. That
it was more apt to do so in Israel than in Judah, is
intelligible from the political origin of the Northern
Schism, and the erection of the national sanctuaries
from motives of mere statecraft.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Erastianism could
hardly be more flagrant or more ludicrous in its opposition
to true religion than at Bethel. And yet how often
have the ludicrousness and the flagrancy been repeated,
with far less temptation! Ever since Christianity
became a state religion, she that needed least to use
the weapons of this world has done so again and
again in a thoroughly Pagan fashion. The attempts
of Churches by law established, to stamp out by law
all religious dissent; or where such attempts were
no longer possible, the charges now of fanaticism and
now of sordidness and religious shopkeeping, which
have been so frequently made against dissent by little
men who fancied their state connection, or their higher
social position, to mean an intellectual and moral superiority;
the absurd claims which many a minister of
religion makes upon the homes and the souls of a
parish, by virtue not of his calling in Christ, but of his
position as official priest of the parish,&mdash;all these are
the sins of Amaziah, priest of Bethel. But they are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
confined to an established Church. The Amaziahs of
dissent are also very many. Wherever the official
masters the spiritual; wherever mere dogma or tradition
is made the standard of preaching; wherever new
doctrine is silenced, or programmes of reform condemned,
as of late years in Free Churches they have
sometimes been, not by spiritual argument, but by the
<i>ipse dixit</i> of the dogmatist, or by ecclesiastical rule or
expediency,&mdash;there you have the same spirit. The
dissenter who checks the Word of God in the name
of some denominational law or dogma is as Erastian as
the churchman who would crush it, like Amaziah, by
invoking the state. These things in all the Churches
are the beggarly rudiments of Paganism; and religious
reform is achieved, as it was that day at Bethel, by the
abjuring of officialism.</p>

<p><i>But Amos answered and said unto Amaziah, No
prophet I, nor prophet's son. But a herdsman</i><a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> <i>I, and a
dresser of sycomores; and Jehovah took me from behind
the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto My
people Israel.</i></p>

<p>On such words we do not comment; we give them
homage. The answer of this shepherd to this priest
is no mere claim of personal disinterestedness. It
is the protest of a new order of prophecy,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> the charter
of a spiritual religion. As we have seen, the <i>sons
of the prophets</i> were guilds of men who had taken to
prophesying because of certain gifts of temper and
natural disposition, and they earned their bread by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
exercise of these. Among such abstract craftsmen
Amos will not be reckoned. He is a prophet, but not
of the kind with which his generation was familiar.
An ordinary member of society, he has been suddenly
called by Jehovah from his civil occupation for a
special purpose and by a call which has not necessarily
to do with either gifts or a profession. This was
something new, not only in itself, but in its consequences
upon the general relations of God to men.
What we see in this dialogue at Bethel is, therefore,
not merely the triumph of a character, however heroic,
but rather a step forward&mdash;and that one of the greatest
and most indispensable&mdash;in the history of religion.</p>

<p>There follows a denunciation of the man who
sought to silence this fresh voice of God. <i>Now therefore
hearken to the word of Jehovah thou that sayest,
Prophesy not against Israel, nor let drop thy words
against the house of Israel; therefore thus saith Jehovah....</i>
Thou hast presumed to say; <i>Hear what God will
say</i>. Thou hast dared to set thine office and system
against His word and purpose. See how they must
be swept away. In defiance of its own rules the
grammar flings forward to the beginnings of its clauses,
each detail of the priest's estate along with the scene
of its desecration. <i>Thy wife in the city&mdash;shall play the
harlot; and thy sons and thy daughters by the sword&mdash;shall
fall; and thy land by the measuring rope&mdash;shall
be divided; and thou in an unclean land&mdash;shalt die.</i>
Do not let us blame the prophet for a coarse cruelty
in the first of these details. He did not invent it.
With all the rest it formed an ordinary consequence
of defeat in the warfare of the times&mdash;an inevitable
item of that general overthrow which, with bitter
emphasis, the prophet describes in Amaziah's own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
words: <i>Israel going shall go into captivity from off his
own land</i>.</p>

<p>There is added a vision in line with the three
which preceded the priest's interruption. We are
therefore justified in supposing that Amos spoke it
also on this occasion, and in taking it as the close
of his address at Bethel. <i>Then the Lord Jehovah gave
me to see: and, behold, a basket of &#7730;aits</i>, that is, <i>summer
fruit. And He said, What art thou seeing, Amos?
And I said, A basket of &#7730;aits. And Jehovah said
unto me, The &#7730;ets&mdash;the End&mdash;has come upon My people
Israel. I will not again pass them over.</i> This does not
carry the prospect beyond the third vision, but it stamps
its finality, and there is therefore added a vivid realisation
of the result. By four disjointed lamentations, <i>howls</i> the
prophet calls them, we are made to feel the last shocks
of the final collapse, and in the utter end an awful
silence. <i>And the songs of the temple shall be changed
into howls in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah. Multitude
of corpses! In every place! He hath cast out! Hush!</i></p>

<p>These then were probably the last words which
Amos spoke to Israel. If so, they form a curious
echo of what was enforced upon himself, and he may
have meant them as such. He was <i>cast out</i>; he was
<i>silenced</i>. They might almost be the verbal repetition
of the priest's orders. In any case the silence is
appropriate. But Amaziah little knew what power he
had given to prophecy the day he forbade it to speak.
The gagged prophet began to write; and those accents
which, humanly speaking, might have died out with the
songs of the temple of Bethel were clothed upon with
the immortality of literature. Amos silenced wrote a
book&mdash;first of prophets to do so&mdash;and this is the
book we have now to study.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<h3><i>ATROCITIES AND ATROCITIES</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> i. 3-ii.</h5>


<p>Like all the prophets of Israel, Amos receives
oracles for foreign nations. Unlike them, however,
he arranges these oracles not after, but before,
his indictment of his own people, and so as to lead
up to this. His reason is obvious and characteristic.
If his aim be to enforce a religion independent of his
people's interests and privileges, how can he better do
so than by exhibiting its principles at work outside
his people, and then, with the impetus drained from
many areas, sweep in upon the vested iniquities of
Israel herself? This is the course of the first section
of his book&mdash;chapters i. and ii. One by one the
neighbours of Israel are cited and condemned in the
name of Jehovah; one by one they are told they must
fall before the still unnamed engine of the Divine Justice.
But when Amos has stirred his people's conscience and
imagination by his judgment of their neighbours' sins,
he turns with the same formula on themselves. Are
they morally better? Are they more likely to resist
Assyria? With greater detail he shows them worse
and their doom the heavier for all their privileges.
Thus is achieved an oratorical triumph, by tactics in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
harmony with the principles of prophecy and remarkably
suited to the tempers of that time.</p>

<p>But Amos achieves another feat, which extends far
beyond his own day. The sins he condemns in the
heathen are at first sight very different from those
which he exposes within Israel. Not only are they
sins of foreign relations, of treaty and war, while
Israel's are all civic and domestic; but they are what we
call the atrocities of Barbarism&mdash;wanton war, massacre
and sacrilege&mdash;while Israel's are rather the sins of
Civilisation&mdash;the pressure of the rich upon the poor,
the bribery of justice, the seduction of the innocent,
personal impurity, and other evils of luxury. So great
is this difference that a critic more gifted with ingenuity
than with insight might plausibly distinguish in the
section before us two prophets with two very different
views of national sin&mdash;a ruder prophet, and of course
an earlier, who judged nations only by the flagrant
drunkenness of their war, and a more subtle prophet,
and of course a later, who exposed the masked
corruptions of their religion and their peace. Such a
theory would be as false as it would be plausible. For
not only is the diversity of the objects of the prophet's
judgment explained by this, that Amos had no familiarity
with the interior life of other nations, and could only
arraign their conduct at those points where it broke
into light in their foreign relations, while Israel's civic
life he knew to the very core. But Amos had besides
a strong and a deliberate aim in placing the sins of
civilisation as the climax of a list of the atrocities of
barbarism. He would recall what men are always
forgetting, that the former are really more cruel and
criminal than the latter; that luxury, bribery and
intolerance, the oppression of the poor, the corruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
of the innocent and the silencing of the prophet&mdash;what
Christ calls offences against His little ones&mdash;are even
more awful atrocities than the wanton horrors of
barbarian warfare. If we keep in mind this moral
purpose, we shall study with more interest than we
could otherwise do the somewhat foreign details of
this section. Horrible as the outrages are which
Amos describes, they were repeated only yesterday by
Turkey: many of the crimes with which he charges
Israel blacken the life of Turkey's chief accuser, Great
Britain.</p>

<p>In his survey Amos includes all the six states of
Palestine that bordered upon Israel, and lay in the way
of the advance of Assyria&mdash;Aram of Damascus, Philistia,
Tyre (for Ph&#339;nicia), Edom, Ammon and Moab. They
are not arranged in geographical order. The prophet
begins with Aram in the north-east, then leaps to
Philistia in the south-west, comes north again to Tyre,
crosses to the south-east and Edom, leaps Moab to
Ammon, and then comes back to Moab. Nor is any
other explanation of his order visible. Damascus heads
the list, no doubt, because her cruelties had been most
felt by Israel, and perhaps too because she lay most
open to Assyria. It was also natural to take next to
Aram Philistia,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> as Israel's other greatest foe; and
nearest to Philistia lay Tyre. The three south-eastern
principalities come together. But there may have been
a chronological reason now unknown to us.</p>

<p>The authenticity of the oracles on Tyre, Edom and
Judah has been questioned: it will be best to discuss
each case as we come to it.</p>

<p>Each of the oracles is introduced by the formula:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
<i>Thus saith,</i> or <i>hath said, Jehovah: Because of three crimes
of ... yea, because of four, I will not turn It back.</i> In
harmony with the rest of the book,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Jehovah is represented
as moving to punishment, not for a single sin,
but for repeated and cumulative guilt. The unnamed
<i>It</i> which God will not recall is not the word of judgment,
but the anger and the hand stretched forth to
smite.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> After the formula, an instance of the nation's
guilt is given, and then in almost identical terms he
decrees the destruction of all by war and captivity.
Assyria is not mentioned, but it is the Assyrian fashion
of dealing with conquered states which is described.
Except in the case of Tyre and Edom, the oracles conclude
as they have begun, by asserting themselves to
be the <i>word of Jehovah</i>, or of <i>Jehovah the Lord</i>. It is
no abstract righteousness which condemns these foreign
peoples, but the God of Israel, and their evil deeds are
described by the characteristic Hebrew word for sin&mdash;<i>crimes</i>,
<i>revolts</i> or <i>treasons</i> against Him.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Aram of Damascus.</span>&mdash;<i>Thus hath Jehovah said:
Because of three crimes of Damascus, yea, because of
four, I will not turn It back; for that they threshed
Gilead with iron</i>&mdash;or <i>basalt threshing-sledges.</i> The word
is <i>iron</i>, but the Arabs of to-day call basalt iron; and
the threshing-sledges, curved slabs<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> drawn rapidly by
horses over the heaped corn, are studded with sharp
basalt teeth that not only thresh out the grain, but chop
the straw into little pieces. So cruelly had Gilead been
chopped by Hazael and his son Ben-Hadad some fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
or forty years before Amos prophesied.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Strongholds

of the Damascus dynasty, but because they were the very
names of the two heaviest oppressors of Israel.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> <i>And I

sceptre from Beth-Eden</i>&mdash;some royal Paradise in that
region of Damascus, which is still the Paradise of the
Arab world&mdash;<i>and the people of Aram shall go captive to
&#7730;ir</i>&mdash;Kir in the unknown north, from which they had
come:<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> <i>Jehovah hath said</i> it.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Philistia.</span>&mdash;<i>Thus saith Jehovah: For three crimes of
Gaza and for four I will not turn It back, because they
led captive a whole captivity, in order to deliver them up
to Edom.</i> It is difficult to see what this means if not
the wholesale depopulation of a district in contrast to
the enslavement of a few captives of war. By all tribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of the ancient world, the captives of their bow and
spear were regarded as legitimate property: it was no
offence to the public conscience that they should be
sold into slavery. But the Philistines seem, without
excuse of war, to have descended upon certain districts
and swept the whole of the population before them,
for purely commercial purposes. It was professional
slave-catching. The Philistines were exactly like the
Arabs of to-day in Africa&mdash;not warriors who win their
captives in honourable fight, but slave-traders, pure and
simple. In warfare in Arabia itself it is still a matter
of conscience with the wildest nomads not to extinguish
a hostile tribe, however bitter one be against
them.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Gaza is chiefly blamed by Amos, for she was
the emporium of the trade on the border of the desert,
with roads and regular caravans to Petra and Elah on
the Gulf of Akaba, both of them places in Edom and
depots for the traffic with Arabia.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> <i>But I will cut off
the inhabitant from Ashdod, and the holder of the sceptre
from Askalon, and I will turn My hand upon Ekron</i>&mdash;four
of the five great Philistine towns, Gath being
already destroyed, and never again to be mentioned
with the others<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>&mdash;<i>and the last of the Philistines shall

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Tyre</span>.&mdash;<i>Thus saith Jehovah: Because of three crimes</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
<i>of Tyre and because of four I will not turn It back;
for that they gave up a whole captivity to Edom</i>&mdash;the
same market as in the previous charge&mdash;<i>and did not
remember the covenant of brethren</i>. We do not know
to what this refers. The alternatives are three: that
the captives were Hebrews and the alliance one between
Israel and Edom; that the captives were Hebrews
and the alliance one between Israel and Tyre;<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> that
the captives were Ph&#339;nicians and the alliance the
natural brotherhood of Tyre and the other Ph&#339;nician
towns.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> But of these three alternatives the first is
scarcely possible, for in such a case the blame would
have been rather Edom's in buying than Tyre's in
selling. The second is possible, for Israel and Tyre
had lived in close alliance for more than two centuries;
but the phrase <i>covenant of brethren</i> is not so
well suited to a league between two tribes who felt
themselves to belong to fundamentally different races,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
as to the close kinship of the Ph&#339;nician communities.
And although, in the scrappy records of Ph&#339;nician
history before this time, we find no instance of so gross
an outrage by Tyre on other Ph&#339;nicians, it is quite
possible that such may have occurred. During next
century Tyre twice over basely took sides with Assyria
in suppressing the revolts of her sister cities.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Besides,
the other Ph&#339;nician towns are not included in the
charge. We have every reason, therefore, to believe
that Amos expresses here not resentment against a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
betrayal of Israel, but indignation at an outrage upon
natural rights and feelings with which Israel's own
interests were not in any way concerned. And this
also suits the lofty spirit of the whole prophecy. <i>But
I will send fire upon the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour
her palaces....</i></p>

<p>This oracle against Tyre has been suspected by
Wellhausen,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> for the following reasons: that it is of
Tyre alone, and silence is kept regarding the other
Ph&#339;nician cities, while in the case of Philistia other
towns than Gaza are condemned; that the charge is the
same as against Gaza; and that the usual close to the
formula is wanting. But it would have been strange
if from a list of states threatened by the Assyrian
doom we had missed Tyre, Tyre which lay in the
avenger's very path. Again, that so acute a critic as
Wellhausen should cite the absence of other Ph&#339;nician
towns from the charge against Tyre is really amazing,
when he has just allowed that it was probably against
some or all of these cities that Tyre's crime was
committed. How could they be included in the
blame of an outrage done upon themselves? The
absence of the usual formula at the close may perhaps
be explained by omission, as indicated above.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Edom.</span>&mdash;<i>Thus saith Jehovah: Because of three
crimes of Edom and because of four I will not turn It
back; for that he pursued with the sword his brother</i>,
who cannot be any other than Israel, <i>corrupted his
natural feelings</i>&mdash;literally <i>his bowels of mercies&mdash;and</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
<i>kept aye fretting</i><a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> <i>his anger, and his passion he watched</i>&mdash;like
a fire, or <i>paid heed</i> to it&mdash;<i>for ever.</i><a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> <i>But I will
send fire upon Teman</i>&mdash;the <i>South</i> Region belonging to
Edom&mdash;<i>and it shall devour the palaces of Bo&#7779;rah</i>&mdash;the
Edomite Bo&#7779;rah, south-east of Petra.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> The Assyrians
had already compelled Edom to pay tribute.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>The objections to the authenticity of this oracle are
more serious than those in the case of the oracle on
Tyre. It has been remarked<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> that before the Jewish
Exile so severe a tone could not have been adopted
by a Jew against Edom, who had been mostly under
the yoke of Judah, and not leniently treated. What
were the facts? Joab subdued Edom for David with
great cruelty.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Jewish governors were set over the
conquered people, and this state of affairs seems to
have lasted, in spite of an Edomite attempt against
Solomon,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> till 850. In Jehoshaphat's reign, 873-850,
<i>there was no king of Edom, a deputy was king</i>, who
towards 850 joined the kings of Judah and Israel in
an invasion of Moab through his territory.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> But, soon
after this invasion and perhaps in consequence of its
failure, Edom revolted from Joram of Judah (849-842),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
who unsuccessfully attempted to put down the revolt.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
The Edomites appear to have remained independent
for fifty years at least. Amaziah of Judah (797-779)
smote them,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> but not it would seem into subjection,
for, according to the Chronicler, Uzziah had to win
back Elath for the Jews after Amaziah's death.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The
history, therefore, of the relations of Judah and Edom
before the time of Amos was of such a kind as to
make credible the existence in Judah at that time of
the feeling about Edom which inspires this oracle.
Edom had shown just the vigilant, implacable hatred
here described. But was the right to blame them
for it Judah's, who herself had so persistently waged
war, with confessed cruelty, against Edom? Could
a Judæan prophet be just in blaming Edom and saying
nothing of Judah? It is true that in the fifty years of
Edom's independence&mdash;the period, we must remember,
from which Amos seems to draw the materials of all
his other charges&mdash;there may have been events to
justify this oracle as spoken by him; and our ignorance
of that period is ample reason why we should pause
before rejecting the oracle so dogmatically as
Wellhausen does. But we have at least serious
grounds for suspecting it. To charge Edom, whom
Judah has conquered and treated cruelly, with restless
hate towards Judah seems to fall below that high
impartial tone which prevails in the other oracles of
this section. The charge was much more justifiable
at the time of the Exile, when Edom did behave
shamefully towards Israel.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Wellhausen points out that
Teman and Bo&#7779;rah are names which do not occur in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the Old Testament before the Exile, but this is uncertain
and inconclusive. The oracle wants the concluding
formula of the rest.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Ammon.</span>&mdash;<i>Thus saith Jehovah: Because of three
crimes of Ammon and because of four I will not turn It
back; for that they ripped up Gilead's women with child&mdash;in
order to enlarge their borders!</i> For such an end they
committed such an atrocity! The crime is one that
has been more or less frequent in Semitic warfare.
Wellhausen cites several instances in the feuds of Arab
tribes about their frontiers. The Turks have been
guilty of it in our own day.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> It is the same charge
which the historian of Israel puts into the mouth of
Elisha against Hazael of Aram,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> and probably the war
was the same; when Gilead was simultaneously attacked
by Arameans from the north and Ammonites from the
south. <i>But I will set fire to the wall of Rabbah</i>&mdash;Rabbath-Ammon,
literally <i>chief</i> or <i>capital</i> of Ammon&mdash;<i>and
it shall devour her palaces, with clamour in the day of
battle, with tempest in the day of storm</i>. As we speak of
"storming a city," Amos and Isaiah<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> use the tempest
to describe the overwhelming invasion of Assyria. There
follows the characteristic Assyrian conclusion: <i>And
their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes</i><a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
<i>together, saith Jehovah</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Moab.</span>&mdash;<i>Thus saith Jehovah: Because of three crimes
of Moab and because of four I will not turn It back; for
that he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime.</i><a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
In the great invasion of Moab, about 850, by Israel,
Judah and Edom conjointly, the rage of Moab seems to
have been directed chiefly against Edom.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Whether
opportunity to appease that rage occurred on the withdrawal
of Israel we cannot say. But either then or
afterwards, balked of their attempt to secure the king
of Edom alive, Moab wreaked their vengeance on his
corpse, and burnt his bones to lime. It was, in the
religious belief of all antiquity, a sacrilege; yet it does not
seem to have been the desecration of the tomb&mdash;or he
would have mentioned it&mdash;but the wanton meanness of
the deed, which Amos felt. <i>And I will send fire on Moab,
and it shall devour the palaces of The-Cities</i>&mdash;&#7730;erîoth,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
perhaps the present &#7730;ureiyat,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> on the Moab plateau
where Chemosh had his shrine<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>&mdash;<i>and in tumult shall
Moab die</i>&mdash;to Jeremiah<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> the Moabites were the sons of
tumult&mdash;<i>with clamour and with the noise of the war-trumpet.
And I will cut off the ruler</i>&mdash;literally <i>judge</i>,
probably the vassal king placed by Jeroboam II.&mdash;<i>from
her</i><a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> <i>midst, and all his</i><a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> <i>princes will I slay with him:
Jehovah hath said</i> it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These, then, are the charges which Amos brings
against the heathen neighbours of Israel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>If we look as a whole across the details through
which we have been working, what we see is a picture
of the Semitic world so summary and so vivid that
we get the like of it nowhere else&mdash;the Semitic world
in its characteristic brokenness and turbulence; its
factions and ferocities, its causeless raids and quarrels,
tribal disputes about boundaries flaring up into the
most terrible massacres, vengeance that wreaks itself
alike on the embryo and the corpse&mdash;<i>cutting up women
with child in Gilead,</i> and <i>burning to lime the bones of the
king of Edom</i>. And the one commerce which binds
these ferocious tribes together is the slave-trade in its
wholesale and most odious form.</p>

<p>Amos treats none of the atrocities subjectively. It
is not because they have been inflicted upon Israel that
he feels or condemns them. The appeals of Israel
against the tyrant become many as the centuries go
on; the later parts of the Old Testament are full of the
complaints of God's chosen people, conscious of their
mission to the world, against the heathen, who prevented
them from it. Here we find none of these complaints,
but a strictly objective and judicial indictment of the
characteristic crimes of heathen men against each
other; and though this is made in the name of Jehovah,
it is not in the interests of His people or of any
of His purposes through them, but solely by the
standard of an impartial righteousness which, as we
are soon to hear, must descend in equal judgment on
Israel.</p>

<p>Again, for the moral principles which Amos enforces
no originality can be claimed. He condemns neither
war as a whole nor slavery as a whole, but limits his
curse to wanton and deliberate aggravations of them:
to the slave-trade in cold blood, in violation of treaties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
and for purely commercial ends;<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> to war for trifling
causes, and that wreaks itself on pregnant women and
dead men; to national hatreds, that never will be still.
Now against such things there has always been in mankind
a strong conscience, of which the word "humanity"
is in itself a sufficient proof. We need not here inquire
into the origin of such a common sense&mdash;whether it be
some native impulse of tenderness which asserts itself
as soon as the duties of self-defence are exhausted, or
some rational notion of the needlessness of excesses,
or whether, in committing these, men are visited
by fear of retaliation from the wrath they have unnecessarily
exasperated. Certain it is, that warriors
of all races have hesitated to be wanton in their war,
and have foreboded the special judgment of heaven
upon every blind extravagance of hate or cruelty.
It is well known how "fey" the Greeks felt the insolence
of power and immoderate anger; they are the fatal
element in many a Greek tragedy.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> But the Semites
themselves, whose racial ferocity is so notorious, are
not without the same feeling. "Even the Beduins' old
cruel rancours are often less than the golden piety of
the wilderness. The danger past, they can think of the
defeated foemen with kindness, ... putting only their
trust in Ullah to obtain the like at need for themselves.
It is contrary to the Arabian conscience to extinguish
a Kabîla."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Similarly in Israel some of the earliest
ethical movements were revolts of the public conscience
against horrible outrages, like that, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
done by the Benjamites of Gibeah.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Therefore in these
oracles on his wild Semitic neighbours Amos discloses
no new ideal for either tribe or individual. Our view
is confirmed that he was intent only upon rousing
the natural conscience of his Hebrew hearers in order
to engage this upon other vices to which it was less
impressionable&mdash;that he was describing those deeds of
war and slavery, whose atrocity all men admitted, only
that he might proceed to bring under the same condemnation
the civic and domestic sins of Israel.</p>

<p>We turn with him, then, to Israel. But in his book
as it now stands in our Bibles, Israel is not immediately
reached. Between her and the foreign nations
two verses are bestowed upon Judah: <i>Thus saith
Jehovah: Because of three crimes of Judah and because
of four I will not turn It back; for that they despised the
Torah of Jehovah, and His statutes they did not observe,
and their falsehoods</i>&mdash;false gods&mdash;<i>led them astray, after
which their fathers walked. But I will send fire on
Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</i>
These verses have been suspected as a later insertion,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
on the ground that every reference to Judah in the
Book of Amos must be late, that the language is very
formal, and that the phrases in which the sin of Judah
is described sound like echoes of Deuteronomy. The
first of these reasons may be dismissed as absurd;
it would have been far more strange if Amos had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
never at all referred to Judah.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> The charges, however,
are not like those which Amos elsewhere makes, and
though the phrases may be quite as early as his
time,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> the reader of the original, and even the reader
of the English version, is aware of a certain tameness
and vagueness of statement, which contrasts remarkably
with the usual pungency of the prophet's style. We
are forced to suspect the authenticity of these verses.</p>

<p>We ought to pass, then, straight from the third to
the sixth verse of this chapter, from the oracles on
foreign nations to that on Northern Israel. It is
introduced with the same formula as they are: <i>Thus
saith Jehovah: Because of three crimes of Israel and
because of four I will not turn It back</i>. But there
follow a greater number of details, for Amos has come
among his own people whom he knows to the heart,
and he applies to them a standard more exact and an
obligation more heavy than any he could lay to the
life of the heathen. Let us run quickly through the
items of his charge. <i>For that they sell an honest man</i><a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
<i>for silver, and a needy man for a pair of shoes</i>&mdash;proverbial,
as we should say "for an old song"&mdash;<i>who
trample to the dust of the earth the head of the poor</i>&mdash;the
least improbable rendering of a corrupt passage<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>&mdash;<i>and
pervert the way of humble men. And a man and</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
<i>his father will go into the maid</i>, the same maid,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> <i>to
desecrate My Holy Name</i>&mdash;without doubt some public
form of unchastity introduced from the Canaanite
worship into the very sanctuary of Jehovah, the holy
place where He reveals His Name&mdash;<i>and on garments
given in pledge they stretch themselves by every altar, and
the wine of those who have been fined they drink in the
house of their God</i>. A riot of sin: the material of their
revels is the miseries of the poor, its stage the house
of God! Such is religion to the Israel of Amos' day&mdash;indoors,
feverish, sensual. By one of the sudden
contrasts he loves, Amos sweeps out of it into God's
ideal of religion&mdash;a great historical movement, told in
the language of the open air: national deliverance,
guidance on the highways of the world, the inspiration
of prophecy, and the pure, ascetic life. <i>But I, I
destroyed the Amorite</i><a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> <i>before you, whose height was as
the cedars, and he was strong as oaks, and I destroyed his
fruit from above and his roots from below.</i> What a
contrast to the previous picture of the temple filled
with fumes of wine and hot with lust! We are out
on open history; God's gales blow and the forests
crash before them. <i>And I brought you up out of
the land of Egypt, and led you through the wilderness
forty years, to inherit the land of the Amorite.</i> Religion
is not chambering and wantonness; it is not selfish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
comfort or profiting by the miseries of the poor and
the sins of the fallen. But religion is history&mdash;the
freedom of the people and their education, the winning
of the land and the defeat of the heathen foe; and
then, when the land is firm and the home secure, it
is the raising, upon that stage and shelter, of spiritual
guides and examples. <i>And I raised up of your sons to
be prophets, and of your young men to be Nazirites</i>&mdash;consecrated
and ascetic lives. <i>Is it not so, O children
of Israel? (oracle of Jehovah). But ye made the
Nazirites drink wine, and the prophets ye charged, saying,
Prophesy not!</i></p>

<p>Luxury, then, and a very sensual conception of
religion, with all their vicious offspring in the abuse
of justice, the oppression of the poor, the corrupting
of the innocent, and the intolerance of spiritual forces&mdash;these
are the sins of an enlightened and civilised
people, which Amos describes as worse than all the
atrocities of barbarism, and as certain of Divine
vengeance. How far beyond his own day are his
words still warm! Here in the nineteenth century
is Great Britain, destroyer of the slave-traffic, and
champion of oppressed nationalities&mdash;yet this great
and Christian people, at the very time they are abolishing
slavery, suffer their own children to work in
factories and clay-pits for sixteen hours a day, and in
mines set women to a labour for which horses are
deemed too valuable. Things improve after 1848, but
how slowly and against what callousness of Christians
Lord Shaftesbury's long and often disappointed labours
painfully testify. Even yet our religious public, that
curses the Turk, and in an indignation, which can
never be too warm, cries out against the Armenian
atrocities, is callous, nay, by the avarice of some, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
haste and passion for enjoyment of many more, and
the thoughtlessness of all, itself contributes, to conditions
of life and fashions of society, which bear with
cruelty upon our poor, taint our literature, needlessly
increase the temptations of our large towns, and render
pure childlife impossible among masses of our population.
Along some of the highways of our Christian
civilisation we are just as cruel and just as lustful as
Kurd or Turk.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Amos closes this prophecy with a vision of immediate
judgment. <i>Behold, I am about to crush</i> or
<i>squeeze down upon you, as a waggon crushes</i><a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> <i>that is full</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
<i>of sheaves.</i><a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> An alternative reading supplies the same
general impression of a crushing judgment: <i>I will
make the ground quake under you, as a waggon makes
it quake,</i> or <i>as a waggon</i> itself <i>quakes under its load of
sheaves</i>. This shock is to be War. <i>Flight shall perish
from the swift, and the strong shall not prove his power,
nor the mighty man escape with his life. And he that
graspeth the bow shall not stand, nor shall the swift of
foot escape, nor the horseman escape with his life. And
he that thinketh himself strong among the heroes shall
flee away naked in that day&mdash;'tis the oracle of Jehovah.</i></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<h3><i>CIVILISATION AND JUDGMENT</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> iii.-iv. 3.</h5>


<p>We now enter the Second Section of the Book
of Amos: chaps. iii.-vi. It is a collection of
various oracles of denunciation, grouped partly by
the recurrence of the formula <i>Hear this word</i>, which
stands at the head of our present chapters iii., iv. and
v., which are therefore probably due to it; partly by
two cries of <i>Woe</i> at v. 18 and vi. 1; and also by the
fact that each of the groups thus started leads up to
an emphatic, though not at first detailed, prediction of
the nation's doom (iii. 13-15; iv. 3; iv. 12; v. 16,
17; v. 26, 27; vi. 14). Within these divisions lie a
number of short indictments, sentences of judgment
and the like, which have no further logical connection
than is supplied by their general sameness of subject,
and a perceptible increase of articulateness from beginning
to end of the Section. The sins of Israel are
more detailed, and the judgment of war, coming from
the North, advances gradually till we discern the
unmistakable ranks of Assyria. But there are various
parentheses and interruptions, which cause the student
of the text no little difficulty. Some of these, however,
may be only apparent: it will always be a question
whether their want of immediate connection with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
precedes them is not due to the loss of several words
from the text rather than to their own intrusion into it.
Of others it is true that they are obviously out of place
as they lie; their removal brings together verses which
evidently belong to each other. Even such parentheses,
however, may be from Amos himself. It is only where
a verse, besides interrupting the argument, seems to
reflect a historical situation later than the prophet's
day, that we can be sure it is not his own. And in
all this textual criticism we must keep in mind, that
the obscurity of the present text of a verse, so far
from being an adequate proof of its subsequent insertion,
may be the very token of its antiquity, scribes
or translators of later date having been unable to
understand it. To reject a verse, only because <i>we</i> do
not see the connection, would surely be as arbitrary, as
the opposite habit of those who, missing a connection,
invent one, and then exhibit their artificial joint as
evidence of the integrity of the whole passage. In
fact we must avoid all headstrong surgery, for to a
great extent we work in the dark.</p>

<p>The general subject of the Section may be indicated
by the title: Religion and Civilisation. A
vigorous community, wealthy, cultured and honestly
religious, are, at a time of settled peace and growing
power, threatened, in the name of the God of justice,
with their complete political overthrow. Their civilisation
is counted for nothing; their religion, on which
they base their confidence, is denounced as false and
unavailing. These two subjects are not, and could not
have been, separated by the prophet in any one of his
oracles. But in the first, the briefest and most
summary of these, chaps. iii.-iv. 3, it is mainly with
the doom of the civil structure of Israel's life that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Amos deals; and it will be more convenient for us to
take them first, with all due reference to the echoes of
them in later parts of the Section. From iv. 4-vi. it
is the Religion and its false peace which he assaults;
and we shall take that in the next chapter. <i>First</i>,
then, Civilisation and Judgment (iii.-iv. 3); <i>Second</i>,
The False Peace of Ritual (iv. 4-vi.).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These few brief oracles open upon the same note as
that in which the previous Section closed&mdash;that the
crimes of Israel are greater than those of the heathen;
and that the people's peculiar relation to God means, not
their security, but their greater judgment. It is then
affirmed that Israel's wealth and social life are so
sapped by luxury and injustice that the nation must
perish. And, as in every luxurious community the
women deserve especial blame, the last of the group
of oracles is reserved for them (iv. 1-3).</p>

<p><i>Hear this word, which Jehovah hath spoken against
you, O children of Israel, against the whole family
which I brought up from the land of Egypt</i>&mdash;Judah as
well as North Israel, so that we see the vanity of a
criticism which would cast out of the Book of Amos
as unauthentic every reference to Judah. <i>Only you
have I known of all the families of the ground</i>&mdash;not world,
but <i>ground</i>, purposely chosen to stamp the meanness
and mortality of them all&mdash;<i>therefore will I visit upon
you all your iniquities</i>.</p>

<p>This famous text has been called by various writers
"the keynote," "the licence" and "the charter" of
prophecy. But the names are too petty for what is
not less than the fulmination of an element. It is a
peal of thunder we hear. It is, in a moment, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
explosion and discharge of the full storm of prophecy.
As when from a burst cloud the streams immediately
below rise suddenly and all their banks are overflowed,
so the prophecies that follow surge and rise clear of
the old limits of Israel's faith by the unconfined,
unmeasured flood of heaven's justice that breaks forth
by this single verse. Now, once for all, are submerged
the lines of custom and tradition within which the course
of religion has hitherto flowed; and, as it were, the
surface of the world is altered. It is a crisis which has
happened more than once again in history: when
helpless man has felt the absolute relentlessness of
the moral issues of life; their renunciation of the past,
however much they have helped to form it; their
sacrifice of every development however costly, and
of every hope however pure; their deafness to prayer,
their indifference to penitence; when no faith saves
a Church, no courage a people, no culture or prestige
even the most exalted order of men; but at the bare
hands of a judgment, uncouth of voice and often
unconscious of a Divine mission, the results of a
great civilisation are for its sins swept remorselessly
away.</p>

<p>Before the storm bursts, we learn by its lightnings
some truths from the old life that is to be destroyed.
<i>You only have I known of all the families of the ground:
therefore will I visit your iniquities upon you.</i> Religion
is no insurance against judgment, no mere atonement
and escape from consequences. Escape! Religion is
only opportunity&mdash;the greatest moral opportunity which
men have, and which if they violate nothing remains
for them but a certain fearful looking forward unto
judgment. You only have I known; and because you
did not take the moral advantage of My intercourse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
because you felt it only as privilege and pride, pardon
for the past and security for the future, therefore doom
the more inexorable awaits you.</p>

<p>Then as if the people had interrupted him with the
question, What sign do you give us that this judgment
is near?&mdash;Amos goes aside into that noble digression
(vv. 3-8) on the harmony between the prophet's word
and the imminent events of the time, which we have
already studied.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> From this apologia, verse 9 returns
to the note of verses 1 and 2 and develops it. Not
only is Israel's responsibility greater than that of other
people's. Her crimes themselves are more heinous.
<i>Make proclamation over the palaces in Ashdod</i>&mdash;if we are
not to read Assyria here,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> then the name of Ashdod
has perhaps been selected from all other heathen
names because of its similarity to the Hebrew word
for that <i>violence</i><a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> with which Amos is charging the
people&mdash;<i>and over the palaces of the land of Egypt, and
say, Gather upon the Mount</i><a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> <i>of Samaria and see! Confusions
manifold in the midst of her; violence to her very
core! Yea, they know not how to do uprightness, saith
Jehovah, who store up wrong and violence in their palaces.</i></p>

<p>"To their crimes," said the satirist of the Romans,
"they owe their gardens, palaces, stables and fine old
plate."<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> And William Langland declared of the rich

off thee thy fortresses, and plundered shall be thy palaces.</i>
Yet this shall be no ordinary tide of Eastern war, to
ebb like the Syrian as it flowed, and leave the nation
to rally on their land again. For Assyria devours the
peoples. <i>Thus saith Jehovah: As the shepherd saveth
from the mouth of the lion a pair of shin-bones or a bit
of an ear, so shall the children of Israel be saved&mdash;they
who sit in Samaria in the corner of the diwan and ...
on a couch.</i><a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> The description, as will be seen from the
note below, is obscure. Some think it is intended to
satirise a novel and affected fashion of sitting adopted
by the rich. Much more probably it means that
carnal security in the luxuries of civilisation which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Amos threatens more than once in similar phrases.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>

of honour.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> To this desert shepherd, with only the
hard ground to rest on, the couches and ivory-mounted
diwans of the rich must have seemed the very
symbols of extravagance. But the pampered bodies that
loll their lazy lengths upon them shall be left like the
crumbs of a lion's meal&mdash;<i>two shin-bones and the bit of an
ear!</i> Their whole civilisation shall perish with them.
<i>Hearken and testify against the house of Israel&mdash;oracle
of the Lord Jehovah, God of Hosts</i><a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>&mdash;those addressed
are still the heathen summoned in ver. 9. <i>For on the
day when I visit the crimes of Israel upon him, I shall
then make visitation upon the altars of Bethel, and the
horns of the altar</i>, which men grasp in their last despair,
<i>shall be smitten and fall to the earth. And I will strike
the winter-house upon the summer-house, and the ivory
houses shall perish, yea, swept away shall be houses many&mdash;oracle
of Jehovah.</i></p>

<p>But the luxury of no civilisation can be measured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
without its women, and to the women of Samaria Amos
now turns with the most scornful of all his words.
<i>Hear this word</i>&mdash;this for you&mdash;<i>kine of Bashan that
are in the mount of Samaria, that oppress the poor, that
crush the needy, that say to their lords, Bring, and let us
drink. Sworn hath the Lord Jehovah by His holiness,
lo, days are coming when there shall be a taking away of
you with hooks, and of the last of you with fish-hooks.</i>
They put hooks<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> in the nostrils of unruly cattle,
and the figure is often applied to human captives;<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
but so many should these cattle of Samaria be that
for the <i>last of them fish-hooks</i> must be used. <i>Yea, by
the breaches</i> in the wall of the stormed city <i>shall ye
go out, every one headlong, and ye shall be cast ...</i><a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
<i>oracle of Jehovah</i>. It is a cowherd's rough picture of
women: a troop of kine&mdash;heavy, heedless animals,
trampling in their anxiety for food upon every frail
and lowly object in the way. But there is a prophet's
insight into character. Not of Jezebels, or Messalinas,
or Lady-Macbeths is it spoken, but of the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
matrons of Samaria. Thoughtlessness and luxury are
able to make brutes out of women of gentle nurture,
with homes and a religion.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are these three or four short oracles of Amos.
They are probably among his earliest&mdash;the first peremptory
challenges of prophecy to that great stronghold
which before forty years she is to see thrown down
in obedience to her word. As yet, however, there
seems to be nothing to justify the menaces of Amos.
Fair and stable rises the structure of Israel's life. A
nation, who know themselves elect, who in politics are
prosperous and in religion proof to every doubt, build
high their palaces, see the skies above them unclouded,
and bask in their pride, heaven's favourites without a
fear. This man, solitary and sudden from his desert,
springs upon them in the name of God and their
poor. Straighter word never came from Deity: <i>Jehovah
hath spoken, who can but prophesy?</i> The insight of
it, the justice of it, are alike convincing. Yet at first
it appears as if it were sped on the personal and very
human passion of its herald. For Amos not only
uses the desert's cruelties&mdash;the lion's to the sheep&mdash;to
figure God's impending judgment upon His people,
but he enforces the latter with all a desert-bred man's
horror of cities and civilisation. It is their costly
furniture, their lavish and complex building, on which
he sees the storm break. We seem to hear again that
frequent phrase of the previous section: <i>the fire shall
devour the palaces thereof</i>. The palaces, he says, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
simply storehouses of oppression; the palaces will be
plundered. Here, as throughout his book,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> couches and
diwans draw forth the scorn of a man accustomed to
the simple furniture of the tent. But observe his
especial hatred of houses. Four times in one verse
he smites them: <i>winter-house on summer-house and the
ivory houses shall perish&mdash;yea, houses manifold, saith the
Lord</i>. So in another oracle of the same section: <i>Houses
of ashlar ye have built, and ye shall not inhabit them;
vineyards of delight have ye planted, and ye shall not drink
of their wine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> And in another: <i>I loathe the pride of
Jacob, and his palaces I hate; and I will give up a city
and all that is in it.... For, lo, the Lord is about to
command, and He will smite the great house into ruins
and the small house into splinters.</i><a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> No wonder that such
a prophet found war with its breached walls insufficient,
and welcomed, as the full ally of his word, the earthquake
itself.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Yet all this is no mere desert "razzia" in the name
of the Lord, a nomad's hatred of cities and the culture
of settled men. It is not a temper; it is a vision of
history. In the only argument which these early
oracles contain, Amos claims to have events on the
side of his word. <i>Shall the lion roar and not be catching</i>
something? Neither does the prophet speak till he
knows that God is ready to act. History accepted this
claim. Amos spoke about 755. In 734 Tiglath-Pileser
swept Gilead and Galilee; in 724 Shalmaneser overran
the rest of Northern Israel: <i>siege and blockade of the
whole land!</i> For three years the Mount of Samaria
was invested, and then taken; the houses overthrown,
the rich and the delicate led away captive. It happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
as Amos foretold; for it was not the shepherd's rage
within him that spoke. He had <i>seen the Lord standing,
and He said, Smite</i>.</p>

<p>But this assault of a desert nomad upon the structure
of a nation's life raises many echoes in history and
some questions in our own minds to-day. Again and
again have civilisations far more powerful than Israel's
been threatened by the desert in the name of God, and
in good faith it has been proclaimed by the prophets
of Christianity and other religions that God's kingdom
cannot come on earth till the wealth, the culture, the
civil order, which men have taken centuries to build,
have been swept away by some great political convulsion.
To-day Christianity herself suffers the same
assaults, and is told by many, the high life and honest
intention of whom cannot be doubted, that till the
civilisation which she has so much helped to create
is destroyed, there is no hope for the purity or the
progress of the race. And Christianity, too, has doubts
within herself. What is the world which our Master
refused in the Mount of Temptation, and so often and
so sternly told us that it must perish?&mdash;how much
of our wealth, of our culture, of our politics, of
the whole fabric of our society? No thoughtful and
religious man, when confronted with civilisation, not
in its ideal, but in one of those forms which give it
its very name, the life of a large city, can fail to ask,
How much of this deserves the judgment of God?
How much must be overthrown, before His will is done
on earth? All these questions rise in the ears and
the heart of a generation, which more than any other
has been brought face to face with the ruins of empires
and civilisations, which have endured longer, and in
their day seemed more stable, than her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>In face of the confused thinking and fanatic speech
which have risen on all such topics, it seems to me that
the Hebrew prophets supply us with four cardinal
rules.</p>

<p>First, of course, they insist that it is the moral
question upon which the fate of a civilisation is decided.
By what means has this system grown? Is justice
observed in essence as well as form? Is there freedom,
or is the prophet silenced? Does luxury or self-denial
prevail? Do the rich make life hard for the poor?
Is childhood sheltered and is innocence respected?
By these, claim the prophets, a nation stands or falls;
and history has proved the claim on wider worlds than
they dreamt of.</p>

<p>But by themselves moral reasons are never enough
to justify a prediction of speedy doom upon any
system or society. None of the prophets began to
foretell the fall of Israel till they read, with keener eyes
than their contemporaries, the signs of it in current
history. And this, I take it, was the point which made
a notable difference between them, and one who like
them scourged the social wrongs of his civilisation, yet
never spoke a word of its fall. Juvenal nowhere calls
down judgments, except upon individuals. In his time
there were no signs of the decline of the empire, even
though, as he marks, there was a flight from the capital
of the virtue which was to keep the empire alive. But
the prophets had political proof of the nearness of God's
judgment, and they spoke in the power of its coincidence
with the moral corruption of their people.</p>

<p>Again, if conscience and history (both of them, to
the prophets, being witnesses of God) thus combine to
announce the early doom of a civilisation, neither the
religion that may have helped to build it, nor any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
remanent virtue in it, nor its ancient value to God, can
avail to save. We are tempted to judge that the long
and costly development of ages is cruelly thrown away
by the convulsion and collapse of an empire; it feels
impious to think that the patience, the providence, the
millennial discipline of the Almighty are to be in a
moment abandoned to some rude and savage force.
But we are wrong. <i>You only have I known of all the
families of the ground</i>, yet I must <i>visit upon you your
iniquities.</i> Nothing is too costly for justice. And God
finds some other way of conserving the real results of
the past.</p>

<p>Again, it is a corollary of all this, that the sentence
upon civilisation must often seem to come by voices
that are insane, and its execution by means that are
criminal. Of course, when civilisation is arraigned as
a whole, and its overthrow demanded, there may be
nothing behind the attack but jealousy or greed, the
fanaticism of ignorant men or the madness of disordered
lives. But this is not necessarily the case. For
God has often in history chosen the outsider as the
herald of doom, and sent the barbarian as its instrument.
By the statesmen and patriots of Israel, Amos
must have been regarded as a mere savage, with a
savage's hate of civilisation. But we know what he
answered when Amaziah called him rebel. And
it was not only for its suddenness that the apostles
said the <i>day of the Lord should come as a thief</i>, but also
because of its methods. For over and over again has
doom been pronounced, and pronounced truly, by men
who in the eyes of civilisation were criminals and
monsters.</p>

<p>Now apply these four principles to the question of
ourselves. It will scarcely be denied that our civilisation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
tolerates, and in part lives by, the existence
of vices which, as we all admit, ruined the ancient
empires. Are the political possibilities of overthrow also
present? That there exist among us means of new
historic convulsions is a thing hard for us to admit.
But the signs cannot be hid. When we see the
jealousies of the Christian peoples, and their enormous
preparations for battle; the arsenals of Europe which a
few sparks may blow up; the millions of soldiers one
man's word may mobilise; when we imagine the opportunities
which a general war would furnish to the
discontented masses of the European proletariat,&mdash;we
must surely acknowledge the existence of forces capable
of inflicting calamities, so severe as to affect not merely
this nationality or that type of culture, but the very
vigour and progress of civilisation herself; and all this
without our looking beyond Christendom, or taking
into account the rise of the yellow races to a consciousness
of their approach to equality with ourselves. If,
then, in the eyes of the Divine justice Christendom
merits judgment,&mdash;if life continue to be left so hard to
the poor; if innocence be still an impossibility for so
much of the childhood of the Christian nations; if with
so many of the leaders of civilisation prurience be
lifted to the level of an art, and licentiousness followed
as a cult; if we continue to pour the evils of our civilisation
upon the barbarian, and "the vices of our
young nobles," to paraphrase Juvenal, "are aped in"
Hindustan,&mdash;then let us know that the means of a
judgment more awful than any which has yet scourged
a delinquent civilisation are extant and actual among
us. And if one should reply, that our Christianity
makes all the difference, that God cannot undo the
development of nineteen centuries, or cannot overthrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the peoples of His Son,&mdash;let us remember that
God does justice at whatever cost; that as He did not
spare Israel at the hands of Assyria, so He did not
spare Christianity in the East when the barbarians of
the desert found her careless and corrupt. <i>You only
have I known of all the families of the ground, therefore
will I visit upon you all your iniquities.</i></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE FALSE PEACE OF RITUAL</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> iv. 4-vi.</h5>


<p>The next four groups of oracles<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>&mdash;iv. 4-13, v.
1-17, v. 18-27 and vi.&mdash;treat of many different
details, and each of them has its own emphasis; but
all are alike in this, that they vehemently attack the
national worship and the sense of political security
which it has engendered. Let us at once make clear
that this worship is the worship of Jehovah. It is true
that it is mixed with idolatry, but, except possibly in
one obscure verse,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Amos does not concern himself with
the idols. What he strikes at, what he would sweep
away, is his people's form of devotion to their own
God. The cult of the national God, at the national
sanctuaries, in the national interest and by the whole
body of the people, who practise it with a zeal unparalleled
by their forefathers&mdash;this is what Amos
condemns. And he does so absolutely. He has
nothing but scorn for the temples and the feasts. The
assiduity of attendance, the liberality of gifts, the
employment of wealth and art and patriotism in worship&mdash;he
tells his generation that God loathes it all. Like
Jeremiah, he even seems to imply that God never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
instituted in Israel any sacrifice or offering.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> It is all
this which gives these oracles their interest for us; and
that interest is not merely historical.</p>

<p>It is indeed historical to begin with. When we find,
not idolatry, but all religious ceremonial&mdash;temples,
public worship, tithes, sacrifice, the praise of God by
music, in fact every material form in which man has
ever been wont to express his devotion to God&mdash;scorned
and condemned with the same uncompromising passion
as idolatry itself, we receive a needed lesson in the
history of religion. For when one is asked, What is
the distinguishing characteristic of heathenism? one is
always ready to say, Idolatry, which is not true. The
distinguishing characteristic of heathenism is the stress
which it lays upon ceremonial. To the pagan religions,
both of the ancient and of the modern world, rites were
the indispensable element in religion. The gifts of the
gods, the abundance of fruits, the security of the state,
depended upon the full and accurate performance of
ritual. In Greek literature we have innumerable illustrations
of this: the <i>Iliad</i> itself starts from a god's anger,
roused by an insult to his priest, whose prayers for
vengeance he hears because sacrifices have been
assiduously offered to him. And so too with the systems
of paganism from which the faith of Israel, though
at first it had so much in common with them, broke
away to its supreme religious distinction. The Semites
laid the stress of their obedience to the gods upon
traditional ceremonies; and no sin was held so heinous
by them as the neglect or infringement of a religious
rite. By the side of it offences against one's fellow-men
or one's own character were deemed mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
misdemeanours. In the day of Amos this pagan superstition
thoroughly penetrated the religion of Jehovah,
and so absorbed the attention of men, that without the
indignant and complete repudiation of it prophecy could
not have started on her task of identifying morality
with religion, and of teaching men more spiritual views
of God. But even when we are thus aware of ceremonialism
as the characteristic quality of the pagan
religions, we have not measured the full reason of that
uncompromising attack on it, which is the chief feature
of this part of the permanent canon of our religion.
For idolatries die everywhere; but everywhere a superstitious
ritualism survives. It continues with philosophies
that have ceased to believe in the gods who
enforced it. Upon ethical movements which have
gained their freedom by breaking away from it, in the
course of time it makes up, and lays its paralysing
weight. With offers of help it flatters religions the
most spiritual in theory and intention. The Pharisees,
than whom few parties had at first purer ideals of
morality, tithed mint, anise and cummin, to the
neglect of the essence of the Law; and even sound
Christians, who have assimilated the Gospel of St. John,
find it hard and sometimes impossible to believe in
salvation apart from their own sacraments, or outside
their own denominational forms. Now this is because
ritual is a thing which appeals both to the baser and
to the nobler instincts of man. To the baser it offers
itself as a mechanical atonement for sin, and a substitute
for all moral and intellectual effort in connection with
faith; to the nobler it insists on a man's need in religion
of order and routine, of sacrament and picture. Plainly
then the words of Amos have significance for more
than the immediate problems of his day. And if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
seem to some, that Amos goes too far with his cry to
sweep away all ceremonial, let them remember, besides
the crisis of his times, that the temper he exposes and
seeks to dissipate is a rank and obdurate error of the
human heart. Our Lord, who recognised the place of
ritual in worship, who said, <i>Thus it behoveth us to fulfil
all righteousness</i>, which righteousness in the dialect of
His day was not the moral law, but man's due of rite,
sacrifice, tithe and alms,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> said also, <i>I will have mercy and
not sacrifice</i>. There is an irreducible minimum of rite
and routine in worship; there is an invaluable loyalty
to traditional habits; there are holy and spiritual uses
in symbol and sacrament. But these are all dispensable;
and because they are all constantly abused, the voice
of the prophet is ever needed which tells us that God
will have none of them; but let justice roll on like
water, and righteousness like an unfailing stream.</p>

<p>For the superstition that ritual is the indispensable
bond between God and man, Amos substitutes two
other aspects of religion. They are history as God's
discipline of man; and civic justice, as man's duty to
God. The first of them he contrasts with religious ceremonialism
in chap. iv. 4-13, and the second in chap. v.;
while in chap. vi. he assaults once more the false
political peace which the ceremonialism engenders.</p>


<h4>1. <span class="smcap"><a id="For_Worship_Chastisement"></a>For Worship, Chastisement.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> iv. 4-13.</h5>

<p>In chap. ii. Amos contrasted the popular conception
of religion as worship with God's conception of it as
history. He placed a picture of the sanctuary, hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
with religious zeal, but hot too with passion and the
fumes of wine, side by side with a great prospect of the
national history: God's guidance of Israel from Egypt
onwards. That is, as we said at the time, he placed an
indoors picture of religion side by side with an open-air
one. He repeats that arrangement here. The
religious services he sketches are more pure, and the
history he takes from his own day; but the contrast
is the same. Again we have on the one side the temple
worship&mdash;artificial, exaggerated, indoors, smoky; but on
the other a few movements of God in Nature, which,
though they all be calamities, have a great moral majesty
upon them. The first opens with a scornful call to
worship, which the prophet, letting out his whole heart
at the beginning, shows to be equivalent to sin. Note
next the impossible caricature of their exaggerated zeal:
sacrifices every morning instead of once a year, tithes
every three days instead of every three years.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> To
offer leavened bread was a departure from the older
fashion of unleavened.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> To publish their liberality was
like the later Pharisees, who were not dissimilarly
mocked by our Lord: <i>When thou doest alms, cause not
a trumpet to be sounded before thee, as the hypocrites do
in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have
glory of men.</i><a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> There is a certain rhythm in the taunt;
but the prose style seems to be resumed with fitness
when the prophet describes the solemn approach of
God in deeds of doom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>
<i>Come away to Bethel and transgress,<br />
At Gilgal exaggerate your transgression!<br />
And bring every morning your sacrifices,<br />
Every three days your tithes!<br />
And send up the savour of leavened bread as a thank-offering,<br />
And call out your liberalities&mdash;make them to be heard!<br />
For so ye love</i> to do, <i>O children of Israel:</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;"><i>Oracle of Jehovah.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p><i>But I on My side have given you cleanness of teeth in
all your cities, and want of bread in all your places&mdash;yet

<p><i>But I on My side withheld from you the winter rain,</i><a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
<i>while it was still three months to the harvest: and I let it
rain repeatedly on one city, and upon one city I did not let
it rain: one lot was rained upon, and the lot that was
not rained upon withered; and two or three cities kept
straggling to one city to drink water, and were not satisfied&mdash;yet
ye did not return to Me: oracle of Jehovah.</i></p>

<p><i>I smote you with blasting and with mildew: many of

<p><i>I overturned among you, like God's own overturning of
Sodom and Gomorrah, till ye became as a brand plucked
from the burning&mdash;yet ye did not return to Me: oracle of
Jehovah.</i></p>

<p>This recalls a passage in that English poem of which
we are again and again reminded by the Book of Amos,
<i>The Vision of Piers Plowman</i>. It is the sermon of
Reason in Passus V. (Skeat's edition):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>In the ancient world it was a settled belief that
natural calamities like these were the effects of the
deity's wrath. When Israel suffers from them the
prophets take for granted that they are for the people's
punishment. I have elsewhere shown how the climate
of Palestine lent itself to these convictions; in this
respect the Book of Deuteronomy contrasts it with
the climate of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> And although some, perhaps
rightly, have scoffed at the exaggerated form of the
belief, that God is angry with the sons of men every
time drought or floods happen, yet the instinct is
sound which in all ages has led religious people to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
feel that such things are inflicted for moral purposes.
In the economy of the universe there may be ends of
a purely physical kind served by such disasters, apart
altogether from their meaning to man. But man at least
learns from them that nature does not exist solely for
feeding, clothing and keeping him wealthy; nor is it
anything else than his monotheism, his faith in God
as the Lord both of his moral life and of nature, which
moves him to believe, as Hebrew prophets taught and
as our early English seer heard Reason herself preach.
Amos had the more need to explain those disasters as
the work of the God of righteousness, because his contemporaries,
while willing to grant Jehovah leadership
in war, were tempted to attribute to the Canaanite gods
of the land all power over the seasons.</p>

<p>What, however, more immediately concerns us in this
passage is its very effective contrast between men's
treatment of God and God's treatment of men. They
lavish upon Him gifts and sacrifices. He&mdash;<i>on His side</i>&mdash;sends
them cleanness of teeth, drought, blasting of
their fruits, pestilence, war and earthquake. That is to
say, they regard Him as a being only to be flattered
and fed. He regards them as creatures with characters
to discipline, even at the expense of their material
welfare. Their views of Him, if religious, are sensuous
and gross; His views of them, if austere, are moral and
ennobling. All this may be grim, but it is exceeding
grand; and short as the efforts of Amos are, we begin
to perceive in him something already of the greatness
of an Isaiah.</p>

<p>And have not those, who have believed as Amos
believed, ever been the strong spirits of our race, making
the very disasters which crushed them to the earth the
tokens that God has great views about them? Laugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
not at the simple peoples, who have their days of
humiliation, and their fast-days after floods and stunted
harvests. For they take these, not like other men, as
the signs of their frailty and helplessness; but as
measures of the greatness God sees in them, His
provocation of their souls to the infinite possibilities
which He has prepared for them.</p>

<p>Israel, however, did not turn even at the fifth call to
penitence, and so there remained nothing for her but a
fearful looking forward to judgment, all the more terrible
that the prophet does not define what the judgment
shall be.</p>

<p><i>Therefore thus shall I do to thee, O Israel: because I
am going to do this to thee, prepare to meet thy God, O
Israel. For, lo, He that formeth the mountains, and
createth the wind, and declareth to man what His thought
is, that maketh morning darkness, and marcheth on the
high places of earth, Jehovah, God of Hosts, is His Name.</i><a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>


<h4>2. <span class="smcap"><a id="For_Worship_Justice"></a>For Worship, Justice.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> v.</h5>

<p>In the next of these groups of oracles Amos continues
his attack on the national ritual, and now contrasts it
with the service of God in public life&mdash;the relief of the
poor, the discharge of justice. But he does not begin
with this. The group opens with an elegy, which
bewails the nation as already fallen. It is always
difficult to mark where the style of a prophet passes
from rhythmical prose into what we may justly call a
metrical form. But in this short wail, we catch the
well-known measure of the Hebrew dirge; not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
artistic as in later poems, yet with at least the characteristic
couplet of a long and a short line.</p>

<p><i>Hear this word which I lift up against you&mdash;a Dirge,
O house of Israel</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Fallen, no more shall she rise,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>Virgin of Israel!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Flung down on her own ground,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>No one to raise her!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>Virgin</i>, which with Isaiah is a standing title for
Jerusalem and occasionally used of other cities, is here
probably the whole nation of Northern Israel. The
explanation follows. It is War. <i>For thus saith the
Lord Jehovah: The city that goeth forth a thousand shall
have an hundred left; and she that goeth forth an hundred
shall have left ten for the house of Israel.</i></p>

<p>But judgment is not yet irrevocable. There break
forthwith the only two promises which lighten the lowering
darkness of the book. Let the people turn to
Jehovah Himself&mdash;and that means let them turn from
the ritual, and instead of it purge their civic life, restore
justice in their courts and help the poor. For God and
moral good are one. It is <i>seek Me and ye shall live</i>, and
<i>seek good and ye shall live</i>. Omitting for the present all
argument as to whether the interruption of praise to
the power of Jehovah be from Amos or another, we
read the whole oracle as follows.</p>

<p><i>Thus saith Jehovah to the house of Israel: Seek Me
and live. But seek not Bethel, and come not to Gilgal,
and to Beersheba pass not over</i>&mdash;to come to Beersheba
one had to cross all Judah. <i>For Gilgal shall taste the
gall of exile</i>&mdash;it is not possible except in this clumsy
way to echo the prophet's play upon words, "Ha-Gilgal
galoh yigleh"&mdash;<i>and Bethel</i>, God's house, <i>shall become an</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
<i>idolatry</i>. This rendering, however, scarcely gives the
rude force of the original; for the word rendered
idolatry, Aven, means also falsehood and perdition,
so that we should not exaggerate the antithesis if we
employed a phrase which once was not vulgar: <i>And
Bethel, house of God, shall go to the devil!</i><a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> The epigram
was the more natural that near Bethel, on a site now
uncertain, but close to the edge of the desert to which
it gave its name, there lay from ancient times a village
actually called Beth-Aven, however the form may have
risen. And we shall find Hosea stereotyping this
epigram of Amos, and calling the sanctuary Beth-Aven
oftener than he calls it Beth-El.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> <i>Seek ye Jehovah and
live,</i> he begins again, <i>lest He break forth like fire, O house
of Joseph, and it consume and there be none to quench at
Bethel.</i><a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> ...<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> <i>He that made the Seven Stars and Orion,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>

rendering of the last verse is uncertain, and rightly
suspected, but there is no alternative so probable, and
it returns to the keynote from which the passage started,
that God should break forth like fire.</p>

<p>Ah, <i>they that turn justice to wormwood, and abase</i><a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
<i>righteousness to the earth! They hate him that reproveth
in the gate</i>&mdash;in an Eastern city both the law-court
and place of the popular council&mdash;<i>and him that
speaketh sincerely they abhor</i>. So in the English mystic's
Vision Peace complains of Wrong:&mdash;</p>

<i>your sins&mdash;ye that browbeat the righteous, take bribes, and

<p><i>Seek good and not evil, that ye may live, and Jehovah
God of Hosts be with you, as ye say</i> He is. <i>Hate evil
and love good; and in the gate set justice on her feet
again&mdash;peradventure Jehovah God of Hosts may have
pity on the remnant of Joseph.</i> If in the Book of Amos
there be any passages, which, to say the least, do not
now lie in their proper places, this is one of them. For,
firstly, while it regards the nation as still responsible
for the duties of government, it recognises them as
reduced to a remnant. To find such a state of affairs
we have to come down to the years subsequent to 734,
when Tiglath-Pileser swept into captivity all Gilead and
Galilee&mdash;that is, two-thirds, in bulk, of the territory
of Northern Israel&mdash;but left Ephraim untouched. In
answer to this, it may, of course, be pointed out
that in thus calling the people to repentance, so that
a remnant might be saved, Amos may have been
contemplating a disaster still future, from which, though
it was inevitable, God might be moved to spare a
remnant.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> That is very true. But it does not meet
this further difficulty, that the verses (14, 15) plainly
make interruption between the end of ver. 13 and
the beginning of ver. 16; and that the initial <i>therefore</i>
of the latter verse, while it has no meaning in its
present sequence, becomes natural and appropriate
when made to follow immediately on ver. 13. For
all these reasons, then, I take vv. 14 and 15 as a
parenthesis, whether from Amos himself or from a
later writer who can tell? But it ought to be kept in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
mind that in other prophetic writings where judgment
is very severe, we have some proof of the later insertion
of calls to repentance, by way of mitigation.</p>

<p>Ver. 13 had said the time was so evil that the
prudent man kept silence. All the more must the
Lord Himself speak, as ver. 16 now proclaims. <i>Therefore
thus saith Jehovah, God of Hosts,</i><a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> <i>Lord: On all
open ways lamentation, and in all streets they shall be
saying, Ah woe! Ah woe! And in all vineyards
lamentation,</i><a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> <i>and they shall call the ploughman to wailing
and to lamentation them that are skilful in dirges</i>&mdash;town
and country, rustic and artist alike&mdash;<i>for I shall pass
through thy midst, saith Jehovah.</i> It is the solemn
formula of the Great Passover, when Egypt was filled
with wailing and there were dead in every house.</p>

<p>The next verse starts another, but a kindred, theme.
As blind as was Israel's confidence in ritual, so blind
was their confidence in dogma, and the popular dogma
was that of the <i>Day of Jehovah</i>.</p>

<p>All popular hopes expect their victory to come in a
single sharp crisis&mdash;a day. And again, the day of
any one means either the day he has appointed, or
the day of his display and triumph. So Jehovah's day
meant to the people the day of His judgment, or of
His triumph: His triumph in war over their enemies,
His judgment upon the heathen. But Amos, whose
keynote has been that judgment begins at home, cries
woe upon such hopes, and tells his people that for them
the day of Jehovah is not victory, but rather insidious,
importunate, inevitable death. And this he describes
as a man who has lived, alone with wild beasts, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the jungles of the Jordan, where the lions lurk, to the
huts of the desert infested by snakes.</p>

<p><i>Woe unto them that long for the day of Jehovah!
What have you to do with the day of Jehovah? It is
darkness, and not light. As when a man fleeth from
the face of a lion, and a bear falls upon him; and he
comes into his home</i>,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> <i>and</i>, breathless, <i>leans his hand upon
the wall, and a serpent bites him.</i> And then, as if appealing
to Heaven for confirmation: Is it not so? <i>Is it
not darkness, the day of Jehovah, and not light? storm
darkness, and not a ray of light upon it?</i></p>

<p>Then Amos returns to the worship, that nurse of
their vain hopes, that false prophet of peace, and he
hears God speak more strongly than ever of its futility
and hatefulness.</p>

<p><i>I hate, I loathe your feasts, and I will not smell the
savour of your gatherings to sacrifice.</i> For with pagan
folly they still believed that the smoke of their burnt-offerings
went up to heaven and flattered the nostrils
of Deity. How ingrained was this belief may be
judged by us from the fact that the terms of it had
to be adopted by the apostles of a spiritual religion,
if they would make themselves understood, and are
now the metaphors of the sacrifices of the Christian
heart.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> <i>Though ye bring to Me burnt-offerings and your
meal-offerings I will not be pleased, or your thank-offerings
of fatted calves, I will not look at them. Let
cease from Me the noise of thy songs; to the playing of
thy viols I will not listen. But let justice roll on like
water, and righteousness like an unfailing stream.</i></p>

<p>Then follows the remarkable appeal from the habits
of this age to those of the times of Israel's simplicity.
<i>Was it flesh- or meal-offerings that ye brought Me in the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
<i>wilderness, forty years, O house of Israel?</i><a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> That is to
say, at the very time when God made Israel His people,
and led them safely to the promised land&mdash;the time
when of all others He did most for them&mdash;He was
not moved to such love and deliverance by the propitiatory
bribes, which this generation imagine to
be so availing and indispensable. Nay, those still
shall not avail, for exile from the land shall now as
surely come in spite of them, as the possession of
the land in old times came without them. This at
least seems to be the drift of the very obscure verse
which follows, and is the unmistakable statement of
the close of the oracle. <i>But ye shall lift up ... your
king and ... your god, images which you have made
for yourselves;</i><a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> <i>and I will carry you away into exile far</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
<i>beyond Damascus, saith Jehovah&mdash;God of Hosts is His
Name!</i><a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> So this chapter closes like the previous, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the marshalling of God's armies. But as there His
hosts were the movements of Nature and the Great
Stars, so here they are the nations of the world. By

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> vi.</h5>

<p>The evil of the national worship was the false political
confidence which it engendered. Leaving the
ritual alone, Amos now proceeds to assault this confidence.
We are taken from the public worship of the
people to the private banquets of the rich, but again
only in order to have their security and extravagance
contrasted with the pestilence, the war and the captivity,
that are rapidly approaching.</p>

<p><i>Woe unto them that are at ease in Zion</i><a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>&mdash;it is a proud
and overweening ease which the word expresses&mdash;<i>and
that trust in the mount of Samaria! Men of mark of the
first of the peoples</i>&mdash;ironically, for that is Israel's opinion
of itself&mdash;<i>and to them do the house of Israel resort!</i>...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
<i>Ye that put off the day of calamity</i><a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> <i>and draw near the
sessions of injustice</i><a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>&mdash;an epigram and proverb, for it
is the universal way of men to wish and fancy far
away the very crisis that their sins are hastening on.
Isaiah described this same generation as drawing
iniquity with cords of hypocrisy, and sin as it were
with a cart-rope! <i>That lie on ivory diwans and sprawl
on their couches</i>&mdash;another luxurious custom, which
filled this rude shepherd with contempt&mdash;<i>and eat lambs
from the flock and calves from the midst of the stall</i><a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
is, only the most delicate of meats&mdash;<i>who prate</i> or
<i>purr</i> or <i>babble to the sound of the viol, and as if they
were David</i> himself <i>invent for them instruments of
song;</i><a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> <i>who drink wine by ewerfuls&mdash;waterpotfuls&mdash;and
anoint with the finest of oil&mdash;yet never do they grieve at
the havoc of Joseph!</i> The havoc is the moral havoc,
for the social structure of Israel is obviously still
secure.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> The rich are indifferent to it; they have
wealth, art, patriotism, religion, but neither heart for
the poverty nor conscience for the sin of their people.
We know their kind! They are always with us, who
live well and imagine they are proportionally clever
and refined. They have their political zeal, will rally
to an election when the interests of their class or
their trade is in danger. They have a robust and
exuberant patriotism, talk grandly of commerce, empire
and the national destiny; but for the real woes and
sores of the people, the poverty, the overwork, the
drunkenness, the dissoluteness, which more affect a
nation's life than anything else, they have no pity and
no care.</p>

<p><i>Therefore now</i>&mdash;the double initial of judgment&mdash;<i>shall
they go into exile at the head of the exiles, and
stilled shall be the revelry of the dissolute</i>&mdash;literally <i>the
sprawlers</i>, as in ver. 4, but used here rather in the
moral than in the physical sense. <i>Sworn hath the
Lord Jehovah by Himself&mdash;'tis the oracle of Jehovah</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
<i>God of Hosts: I am loathing</i><a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> <i>the pride of Jacob, and his
palaces do I hate, and I will pack up a city and its fulness.</i><a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>... <i>For,
behold, Jehovah is commanding, and He
will smite the great house into ruins and the small house
into splinters.</i> The collapse must come, postpone it
as their fancy will, for it has been worked for and is
inevitable. How could it be otherwise? <i>Shall horses
run on a cliff, or the sea be ploughed by oxen</i><a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>&mdash;<i>that ye
should turn justice to poison and the fruit of righteousness
to wormwood! Ye that exult in Lo-Debar and
say, By our own strength have we taken to ourselves
&#7730;arnaim.</i> So Grätz rightly reads the verse. The
Hebrew text and all the versions take these names as
if they were common nouns&mdash;Lo-Debar, <i>a thing of
nought</i>; &#7730;arnaim, <i>a pair of horns</i>&mdash;and doubtless it was
just because of this possible play upon their names,
that Amos selected these two out of all the recent
conquests of Israel. Karnaim, in full Ashteroth
Karnaim, <i>Astarte of Horns</i>, was that immemorial
fortress and sanctuary which lay out upon the great
plateau of Bashan towards Damascus; so obvious and
cardinal a site that it appears in the sacred history
both in the earliest recorded campaign in Abraham's
time and in one of the latest under the Maccabees.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
Lo-Debar was of Gilead, and probably lay on that
last rampart of the province northward, overlooking
the Yarmuk, a strategical point which must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
often been contested by Israel and Aram, and with
which no other Old Testament name has been identified.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
These two fortresses, with many others, Israel
had lately taken from Aram; but not, as they boasted,
<i>by their own strength</i>. It was only Aram's pre-occupation
with Assyria now surgent on the northern flank,
which allowed Israel these easy victories. And this
same northern foe would soon overwhelm themselves.
<i>For, behold, I am to raise up against you, O house of
Israel&mdash;'tis the oracle of Jehovah God of the hosts</i><a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>&mdash;<i>a
Nation, and they shall oppress you from the Entrance of
Hamath to the Torrent of the 'Arabah.</i> Every one knows
the former, the Pass between the Lebanons, at whose
mouth stands Dan, northern limit of Israel; but it is
hard to identify the latter. If Amos means to include
Judah, we should have expected the Torrent of
Egypt, the present Wady el 'Arish; but the Wady of
the 'Arabah may be a corresponding valley in the
eastern watershed issuing in the 'Arabah. If Amos
threatens only the Northern Kingdom, he intends some
wady running down to that Sea of the 'Arabah, the
Dead Sea, which is elsewhere given as the limit of
Israel.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>The Assyrian flood, then, was about to break, and
the oracles close with the hopeless prospect of the
whole land submerged beneath it.</p>


<h4>4. <span class="smcap"><a id="A_Fragment_from_the_Plague"></a>A Fragment from the Plague.</span></h4>

<p>In the above exposition we have omitted two very
curious verses, 9 and 10, which are held by some
critics to interrupt the current of the chapter, and to
reflect an entirely different kind of calamity from that
which it predicts. I do not think these critics right,
for reasons I am about to give; but the verses are so
remarkable that it is most convenient to treat them
by themselves apart from the rest of the chapter.
Here they are, with the verse immediately in front of
them.</p>

<p><i>I am loathing the pride of Jacob, and his palaces I
hate. And I will give up a city and its fulness</i> to ...(perhaps
<i>siege</i> or <i>pestilence</i>?). <i>And it shall come to
pass, if there be left ten men in one house, and they
die,</i><a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> ... <i>that his cousin</i><a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> <i>and the man to burn him shall
lift him to bring the body</i><a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> <i>out of the house, and they
shall say to one who is in the recesses of the house</i>,<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
<i>Are there any more with thee? And he shall say, Not
one ... and they shall say, Hush!</i> (<i>for one must not
make mention of the name of Jehovah</i>).</p>

<p>This grim fragment is obscure in its relation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
context. But the death of even so large a household
as ten&mdash;the funeral left to a distant relation&mdash;the disposal
of the bodies by burning instead of the burial
customary among the Hebrews<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>&mdash;sufficiently reflect the
kind of calamity. It is a weird little bit of memory,
the recollection of an eye-witness, from one of those
great pestilences which, during the first half of the
eighth century, happened not seldom in Western Asia.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
But what does it do here? Wellhausen says that
there is nothing to lead up to the incident; that before
it the chapter speaks, not of pestilence, but only of
political destruction by an enemy. This is not accurate.
The phrase immediately preceding may mean either <i>I
will shut up a city and its fulness</i>, in which case a siege
is meant, and a siege was the possibility both of famine
and pestilence; or <i>I will give up the city and its fulness</i>...,
in which case a word or two may have been
dropped, as words have undoubtedly been dropped at
the end of the next verse, and one ought perhaps to
add <i>to the pestilence</i>.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> The latter alternative is the
more probable, and this may be one of the passages,
already alluded to,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> in which the want of connection
with the preceding verses is to be explained, not upon
the favourite theory that there has been a violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
intrusion into the text, but upon the too much neglected
hypothesis that some words have been lost.</p>

<p>The uncertainty of the text, however, does not
weaken the impression of its ghastly realism: the
unclean and haunted house; the kinsman and the
body-burner afraid to search through the infected
rooms, and calling in muffled voice to the single
survivor crouching in some far corner of them, <i>Are
there any more with thee?</i> his reply, <i>None</i>&mdash;himself
the next! Yet these details are not the most weird.
Over all hangs a terror darker than the pestilence.
<i>Shall there be evil in a city and Jehovah not have done it?</i>
Such, as we have heard from Amos, was the settled
faith of the age. But in times of woe it was held with
an awful and a craven superstition. The whole of life
was believed to be overhung with loose accumulations
of Divine anger. And as in some fatal hollow in the
high Alps, where any noise may bring down the
impending masses of snow, and the fearful traveller
hurries along in silence, so the men of that superstitious
age feared, when an evil like the plague was imminent,
even to utter the Deity's name, lest it should loosen
some avalanche of His wrath. <i>And he said, Hush! for</i>,
adds the comment, one <i>must not make mention of the
name of Jehovah</i>.</p>

<p>This reveals another side of the popular religion
which Amos has been attacking. We have seen it
as the sheer superstition of routine; but we now
know that it was a routine broken by panic. The
God who in times of peace was propitiated by regular
supplies of savoury sacrifice and flattery, is conceived,
when His wrath is roused and imminent, as kept
quiet only by the silence of its miserable objects.
The false peace of ritual is tempered by panic.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<h3><i>DOOM OR DISCIPLINE?</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> viii. 4-ix.</h5>


<p>We now enter the Third Section of the Book of
Amos: chaps. vii.-ix. As we have already
treated the first part of it&mdash;the group of four visions,
which probably formed the prophet's discourse at
Bethel, with the interlude of his adventure there
(vii.-viii. 3)<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>&mdash;we may pass at once to what remains:
from viii. 4 to the end of the book. This portion
consists of groups of oracles more obscure in their
relations to each other than any we have yet studied,
and probably containing a number of verses which are
not from Amos himself. They open in a denunciation
of the rich, which echoes previous oracles, and soon
pass to judgments of a kind already threatened, but
now with greater relentlessness. Then, just as all is
at the darkest, lights break; exceptions are made;
the inevitable captivity is described no more as doom,
but as discipline; and, with only this preparation for
a change, we are swept out on a scene, in which,
although the land is strewn with the ruins that have
been threatened, the sunshine of a new day floods
them; the promise of restoration is given; Nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
herself will be regenerated, and the whole life of Israel
planted on its own ground again.</p>

<p>Whether it was given to Amos himself to behold
this day&mdash;whether these last verses of the book were
his "Nunc Dimittis," or the hope of a later generation,
which found his book intolerably severe, and mingled
with its judgments their own new mercies&mdash;we shall
try to discover further on. Meanwhile there is no
doubt that we start with the authentic oracles of the
prophet. We know the ring of his voice. To the
tyranny of the rich, which he has so often lashed, he
now adds the greed and fraud of the traders; and he
paints Israel's doom in those shapes of earthquake,
eclipse and famine with which his own generation
had recently become familiar. Note that in this first
group Amos employs only physical calamities, and
says nothing of war and captivity. If the standard
which we have already applied to the growth of his
doctrine be correct, these ought therefore to be counted
among his earlier utterances. War and captivity follow
in chap. ix. That is to say, this Third Section follows
the same line of development as both the First and
the Second.</p>


<h4>1. <span class="smcap"><a id="Earthquake_Eclipse_and_Famine"></a>Earthquake, Eclipse and Famine.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> viii. 4-14.</h5>

<p><i>Hear this, ye who trample the needy, and would put
an end to</i><a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> <i>the lowly of the land, saying, When will
the New-Moon be over, that we may sell grain, and the
Sabbath, that we may open corn</i> (<i>by making small the
measure, but large the weight, and falsifying the fraudulent
balances; buying the wretched for silver, and the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
<i>needy for a pair of shoes!</i>), <i>and that we may sell as grain
the refuse of the corn!</i> The parenthesis puzzles, but is
not impossible: in the speed of his scorn, Amos might
well interrupt the speech of the merchants by these
details of their fraud,<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> flinging these in their teeth
as they spoke. The existence at this date of the
New-Moon and Sabbath as days of rest from business
is interesting; but even more interesting is the peril
to which they lie open. As in the case of the Nazirites
and the prophets, we see how the religious institutions
and opportunities of the people are threatened by
worldliness and greed. And, as in every other relevant
passage of the Old Testament, we have the interests
of the Sabbath bound up in the same cause with the
interests of the poor. The Fourth Commandment
enforces the day of rest on behalf of the servants and
bondsmen. When a later prophet substitutes for
religious fasts the ideals of social service, he weds
with the latter the security of the Sabbath from all
business.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> So here Amos emphasises that the Sabbath
is threatened by the same worldliness and love of
money which tramples on the helpless. The interests
of the Sabbath are the interests of the poor: the
enemies of the Sabbath are the enemies of the poor.
And all this illustrates our Saviour's saying, that <i>the
Sabbath was made for man</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>But, as in the rest of the book, judgment again
follows hard on sin. <i>Sworn hath Jehovah by the pride
of Jacob, Never shall I forget their deeds.</i> It is as before.
The chief spring of the prophet's inspiration is his
burning sense of the personal indignation of God
against crimes so abominable. God is the God of
the poor, and His anger rises, as we see the anger
of Christ arise, heavy against their tyrants and oppressors.
Such sins are intolerable to Him. But the
feeling of their intolerableness is shared by the land
itself, the very fabric of nature; the earthquake is the
proof of it. <i>For all this shall not the land tremble and
her every inhabitant mourn? and she shall rise like the
Nile in mass, and heave and sink like the Nile of Egypt.</i><a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>To the earthquake is added the eclipse: one had
happened in 803, and another in 763, the memory of
which probably inspired the form of this passage. <i>And
it shall be in that day&mdash;'tis the oracle of the Lord Jehovah&mdash;that
I shall bring down the sun at noon, and cast darkness
on the earth in broad day.</i><a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> <i>And I will turn your
festivals into mourning, and all your songs to a dirge.
And I will bring up upon all loins sackcloth and on
every head baldness, and I will make it like the mourning
for an only son, and the end of it as a bitter day.</i></p>

<p>But the terrors of earthquake and eclipse are not
sufficient for doom, and famine is drawn upon.</p>

<p><i>Lo, days are coming&mdash;'tis the oracle of the Lord
Jehovah&mdash;that I will send famine on the land, not a
famine of bread nor a drouth of water, but of hearing
the words of Jehovah. And they shall wander from sea</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
<i>to sea, and from the dark North to the Sunrise shall they
run to and fro, to seek the word of Jehovah, and they shall
not find it; ... who swear by Samaria's Guilt</i>&mdash;the
golden calf in the house of the kingdom at Bethel<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>&mdash;<i>and
say, As liveth thy God, O Dan! and, As liveth the way
to Beersheba! and they shall fall and not rise any more</i>.
I have omitted ver. 13: <i>in that day shall the fair maids
faint and the youths for thirst</i>; and I append my reasons
in a note. Some part of the received text must go, for
while vv. 11 and 12 speak of a spiritual drought, the
drought of 13 is physical. And ver. 14 follows 12
better than it follows 13. The oaths mentioned by
Bethel, Dan, Beersheba, are not specially those of young
men and maidens, but of the whole nation, that run
from one end of the land to the other, Dan to Beersheba,
seeking for some word of Jehovah.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> One of the
oaths, <i>As liveth the way to Beersheba</i>,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> is so curious that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
some have doubted if the text be correct. But strange
as it may appear to us to speak of the life of the lifeless,
this often happens among the Semites. To-day Arabs
"swear <i>wa hyât</i>, 'by the life of,' even of things
inanimate; 'By the life of this fire, or of this coffee.'"<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
And as Amos here tells us that the Israelite pilgrims
swore by the way to Beersheba, so do the Moslems
affirm their oaths by the sacred way to Mecca.</p>

<p>Thus Amos returns to the chief target of his shafts&mdash;the
senseless, corrupt worship of the national sanctuaries.
And this time&mdash;perhaps in remembrance of
how they had silenced the word of God when he brought
it home to them at Bethel&mdash;he tells Israel that, with all
their running to and fro across the land, to shrine after
shrine in search of the word, they shall suffer from
a famine and drouth of it. Perhaps this is the most
effective contrast in which Amos has yet placed the
stupid ritualism of his people. With so many things
to swear by; with so many holy places that once were
the homes of Vision, Abraham's Beersheba, Jacob's
Bethel, Joshua's Gilgal&mdash;nay, a whole land over which
God's voice had broken in past ages, lavish as the rain;
with, too, all their assiduity of sacrifice and prayer, they
should nevertheless starve and pant for that living
word of the Lord, which they had silenced in His
prophet.</p>

<p>Thus, men may be devoted to religion, may be
loyal to their sacred traditions and institutions, may
haunt the holy associations of the past and be very
assiduous with their ritual&mdash;and yet, because of their
worldliness, pride and disobedience, never feel that
moral inspiration, that clear call to duty, that comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
in pain, that hope in adversity, that good conscience
at all times, which spring up in the heart like living
water. Where these be not experienced, orthodoxy,
zeal, lavish ritual, are all in vain.</p>


<h4>2. <span class="smcap"><a id="Nemesis"></a>Nemesis.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> ix. 1-6.</h5>

<p>There follows a Vision in Bethel, the opening of
which, <i>I saw the Lord</i>, immediately recalls the great
inauguration of Isaiah. He also <i>saw the Lord</i>; but
how different the Attitude, how other the Word! To
the statesman-prophet the Lord is <i>enthroned</i>, surrounded
by the court of heaven; and though the temple rocks
to the intolerable thunder of their praise, they bring
to the contrite man beneath the consciousness of a
life-long mission. But to Amos the Lord is <i>standing</i>
and alone&mdash;to this lonely prophet God is always alone&mdash;and
His message may be summed up in its initial
word, <i>Smite</i>. There&mdash;Government: hierarchies of
service, embassies, clemencies, healings, and though
at first devastation, thereafter the indestructible hope
of a future. Here&mdash;Judgment: that Figure of Fate
which terror's fascinated eye ever sees alone; one final
blow and irreparable ruin. And so, as with Isaiah we
saw how constructive prophecy may be, with Amos
we behold only the preparatory havoc, the levelling
and clearing of the ground of the future.</p>

<p><i>I have seen the Lord standing over the Altar, and
He said, Smite the capital</i>&mdash;of the pillar&mdash;<i>that the very
thresholds</i><a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> <i>quake, and break them on the head of all
of them!</i> It is a shock that makes the temple reel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
from roof-tree to basement. The vision seems subsequent
to the prophet's visit to Bethel; and it gathers
his whole attack on the national worship into one
decisive and irreparable blow. <i>The last of them will
I slay with the sword: there shall not flee away of them
one fugitive: there shall not escape of them a</i> single
<i>survivor!</i> Neither hell nor heaven, mountain-top nor
sea-bottom, shall harbour one of them. <i>If they break
through to Sheol, thence shall My hand take them; and
if they climb to heaven, thence shall I bring them down.
If they hide in Carmel's top, thence will I find them out
and fetch them; and if they conceal themselves from
before Mine eyes in the bottom of the sea, thence shall I
charge the Serpent and he shall bite them; and if they go
into captivity before their foes</i>&mdash;to Israel as terrible a
distance from God's face as Sheol itself!&mdash;<i>thence will
I charge the sword and it shall slay them; and I will set
Mine eye upon them for evil and not for good</i>.</p>

<p>It is a ruder draft of the Hundred and Thirty-Ninth
Psalm; but the Divine Pursuer is Nemesis, and not
Conscience.</p>

<p><i>And the Lord, Jehovah of the Hosts; Who toucheth

<h4>3. <span class="smcap"><a id="The_Voices_of_Another_Dawn"></a>The Voices of Another Dawn.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> ix. 7-15.</h5>

<p>And now we are come to the part where, as it seems,
voices of another day mingle with that of Amos, and
silence his judgments in the chorus of their unbroken
hope. At first, however, it is himself without doubt
who speaks. He takes up the now familiar truth,
that when it comes to judgment for sin, Israel is no
dearer to Jehovah than any other people of His equal
Providence.</p>

<p><i>Are ye not unto Me, O children of Israel&mdash;'tis the oracle
of Jehovah&mdash;just like the children of Kushites?</i> mere
black folk and far away! <i>Did I not bring up Israel
from Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram
from &#7730;ir?</i> Mark again the universal Providence which
Amos proclaims: it is the due concomitant of his
universal morality. Once for all the religion of Israel
breaks from the characteristic Semitic belief that gave
a god to every people, and limited both his power and
his interests to that people's territory and fortunes.
And if we remember how everything spiritual in the
religion of Israel, everything in its significance for
mankind, was rendered possible only because at this
date it broke from and abjured the particularism in
which it had been born, we shall feel some of the
Titanic force of the prophet, in whom that break was
achieved with an absoluteness which leaves nothing to
be desired. But let us also emphasise, that it was
by no mere method of the intellect or observation of
history that Amos was led to assert the unity of the
Divine Providence. The inspiration in this was a
moral one: Jehovah was ruler and guide of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
families of mankind, because He was exalted in righteousness;
and the field in which that righteousness was
proved and made manifest was the life and the fate of
Israel. Therefore to this Amos now turns. <i>Lo, the
eyes of the Lord Jehovah are on the sinful kingdom, and
I will destroy it from the face of the ground.</i> In other
words, Jehovah's sovereignty over the world was not
proved by Israel's conquest of the latter, but by His
unflinching application of the principles of righteousness,
at whatever cost, to Israel herself.</p>

<p>Up to this point, then, the voice of Amos is unmistakable,
uttering the doctrine, so original to him, that
in the judgment of God Israel shall not be specially
favoured, and the sentence, we have heard so often
from him, of her removal from her land. Remember,
Amos has not yet said a word in mitigation of the
sentence: up to this point of his book it has been
presented as inexorable and final. But now to a statement
of it as absolute as any that has gone before,
there is suddenly added a qualification: <i>nevertheless I
will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob&mdash;'tis the oracle
of Jehovah</i>. And then there is added a new picture
of exile changed from doom to discipline, a process of
sifting by which only the evil in Israel, <i>all the sinners
of My people</i>, shall perish, but not a grain of the good.
<i>For, lo, I am giving command, and I will toss the house
of Israel among all the nations, like</i> something <i>that is
tossed in a sieve, but not a pebble</i><a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> <i>shall fall to earth. By
the sword shall die all the sinners of My people, they who
say, The calamity shall not reach nor anticipate us.</i><a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>Now as to these qualifications of the hitherto
unmitigated judgments of the book, it is to be noted
that there is nothing in their language to lead us to
take them from Amos himself. On the contrary, the
last clause describes what he has always called a
characteristic sin of his day. Our only difficulties are
that hitherto Amos has never qualified his sentences
of doom, and that the change now appears so
suddenly that the two halves of the verse in which it
does so absolutely contradict each other. Read them
again, ver. 8: <i>Lo, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are on
the sinful nation, and I will destroy it from off the
face of the ground&mdash;nevertheless destroying I shall not
destroy the house of Jacob: 'tis the oracle of Jehovah.</i>
Can we believe the same prophet to have uttered at
the same time these two statements? And is it
possible to believe that prophet to be the hitherto
unwavering, unqualifying Amos? Noting these things,
let us pass to the rest of the chapter. We break from
all shadows; the verses are verses of pure hope. The
judgment on Israel is not averted; but having taken
place her ruin is regarded as not irreparable.</p>

<p><i>In that day</i>&mdash;the day Amos has threatened of overthrow
and ruin&mdash;<i>I will raise again the fallen hut of David and
will close up its breaches, and his ruins I will raise, and
I will build it up as in the days of old</i>,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> <i>that they may
possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations upon</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
<i>whom My Name has been called</i>&mdash;that is, as once their
Possessor&mdash;<i>'tis the oracle of Jehovah, He who is about
to do this</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>fallen hut of David</i> undoubtedly means the fall
of the kingdom of Judah. It is not language Amos
uses, or, as it seems to me, could have used, of the fall
of the Northern Kingdom only.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> Again, it is undoubted
that Amos contemplated the fall of Judah: this is
implicit in such a phrase as <i>the whole family that I
brought up from Egypt</i>.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> He saw then <i>the day</i> and <i>the
ruins</i> of which ver. 11 speaks. The only question is,
can we attribute to him the prediction of a restoration
of these ruins? And this is a question which must
be answered in face of the facts that the rest of his
book is unrelieved by a single gleam of hope, and that
his threat of the nation's destruction is absolute and
final. Now it is significant that in face of those facts
Cornill (though he has changed his opinion) once believed
it was "surely possible for Amos to include restoration
in his prospect of ruin," as (he might have added) other
prophets undoubtedly do. I confess I cannot so readily
get over the rest of the book and its gloom; and am
the less inclined to be sure about these verses being
Amos' own that it seems to have been not unusual for
later generations, for whom the daystar was beginning to
rise, to add their own inspired hopes to the unrelieved
threats of their predecessors of the midnight. The
mention of Edom does not help us much: in the
days of Amos after the partial conquest by Uzziah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the promise of <i>the rest of Edom</i> was singularly
appropriate. On the other hand, what interest had so
purely ethical a prophet in the mere addition of territory?
To this point we shall have to return for our final
decision. We have still the closing oracle&mdash;a very
pleasant piece of music, as if the birds had come out
after the thunderstorm, and the wet hills were glistening
in the sunshine.</p>

<p><i>Lo, days are coming&mdash;'tis the oracle of Jehovah&mdash;when
the ploughman shall catch up the reaper, and the grape-treader
him that streweth the seed.</i> The seasons shall
jostle each other, harvest following hard upon seed-time,
vintage upon spring. It is that "happy
contention of seasons" which Josephus describes as
the perpetual blessing of Galilee.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> <i>And the mountains
shall drip with new wine, and all the hills shall flow down.
And I will bring back the captivity of My people Israel,
and they shall build the waste cities and dwell</i> in them,
<i>and plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof, and make
gardens and eat their fruits. And I will plant them on
their own ground; and they shall not be uprooted any
more from their own ground which I have given to them,
saith Jehovah thy God.</i><a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Again we meet the difficulty:
does the voice that speaks here speak with captivity
already realised? or is it the voice of one who projects
himself forward to a day, which, by the oath of the
Lord Himself, is certain to come?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now surveyed the whole of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
much-doubted, much-defended passage. I have stated fully
the arguments on both sides. On the one hand, we
have the fact that nothing in the language of the verses,
and nothing in their historical allusions, precludes
their being by Amos; we have also to admit that,
having threatened a day of ruin, it was possible for
Amos to realise by his mind's eye its arrival, and
standing at that point to see the sunshine flooding the
ruins and to prophesy a restoration. In all this there
is nothing impossible in itself or inconsistent with the
rest of the book. On the other hand, we have the
impressive and incommensurable facts: <i>first</i>, that this
change to hope comes suddenly, without preparation and
without statement of reasons, at the very end of a book
whose characteristics are not only a final and absolute
sentence of ruin upon the people, and an outlook of
unrelieved darkness, but scornful discouragement of
every popular vision of a prosperous future; and, <i>second</i>,
that the prophetic books contain numerous signs that
later generations wove their own brighter hopes into
the abrupt and hopeless conclusions of prophecies of
judgment.</p>

<p>To this balance of evidence is there anything to
add? I think there is; and that it decides the question.
All these prospects of the future restoration
of Israel are absolutely without a moral feature. They
speak of return from captivity, of political restoration, of
supremacy over the Gentiles, and of a revived Nature,
hanging with fruit, dripping with must. Such hopes
are natural and legitimate to a people who were long
separated from their devastated and neglected land,
and whose punishment and penitence were accomplished.
But they are not natural to a prophet like Amos.
Imagine him predicting a future like this! Imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
him describing the consummation of his people's history,
without mentioning one of those moral triumphs to
rally his people to which his whole passion and energy
had been devoted. To me it is impossible to hear the
voice that cried, <i>Let justice roll on like waters and
righteousness like a perennial stream</i>, in a peroration which
is content to tell of mountains dripping with must and
of a people satisfied with vineyards and gardens. These
are legitimate hopes; but they are the hopes of a
generation of other conditions and of other deserts
than the generation of Amos.</p>

<p>If then the gloom of this great book is turned into
light, such a change is not due to Amos.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<h3><i>COMMON-SENSE AND THE REIGN OF LAW</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Amos</span> iii. 3-8; iv. 6-13; v. 8, 9; vi. 12; viii. 8; ix. 5, 6.</h5>


<p>Fools, when they face facts, which is seldom,
face them one by one, and, as a consequence,
either in ignorant contempt or in panic. With this
inordinate folly Amos charged the religion of his day.
The superstitious people, careful of every point of
ritual and very greedy of omens, would not ponder
real facts nor set cause to effect. Amos recalled them
to common life. <i>Does a bird fall upon a snare, except
there be a loop on her? Does the trap itself rise front
the ground, except it be catching something</i>&mdash;something
alive in it that struggles, and so lifts the trap? <i>Shall
the alarum be blown in a city, and the people not tremble?</i>
Daily life is impossible without putting two and two
together. But this is just what Israel will not do with
the sacred events of their time. To religion they will
not add common-sense.</p>

<p>For Amos himself, all things which happen are in
sequence and in sympathy. He has seen this in the
simple life of the desert; he is sure of it throughout
the tangle and hubbub of history. One thing explains
another; one makes another inevitable. When he has
illustrated the truth in common life, Amos claims it for
especially four of the great facts of the time. The sins
of society, of which society is careless; the physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
calamities, which they survive and forget; the approach
of Assyria, which they ignore; the word of
the prophet, which they silence,&mdash;all these belong to
each other. Drought, Pestilence, Earthquake, Invasion
conspire&mdash;and the Prophet holds their secret.</p>

<p>Now it is true that for the most part Amos describes
this sequence of events as the personal action of Jehovah.
<i>Shall evil befall, and Jehovah not have done it?... I
have smitten you.... I will raise up against you a
Nation.... Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel!</i><a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Yet
even where the personal impulse of the Deity is thus
emphasised, we feel equal stress laid upon the order
and the inevitable certainty of the process. Amos
nowhere uses Isaiah's great phrase: <i>a God of Mishpat</i>,
a <i>God of Order</i> or <i>Law</i>. But he means almost the same
thing: God works by methods which irresistibly fulfil
themselves. Nay more. Sometimes this sequence
sweeps upon the prophet's mind with such force as
to overwhelm all his sense of the Personal within it.
The Will and the Word of the God who causes the
thing are crushed out by the "Must Be" of the thing
itself. Take even the descriptions of those historical
crises, which the prophet most explicitly proclaims as
the visitations of the Almighty. In some of the verses
all thought of God Himself is lost in the roar and
foam with which that tide of necessity bursts up
through them. The fountains of the great deep break
loose, and while the universe trembles to the shock, it
seems that even the voice of the Deity is overwhelmed.
In one passage, immediately after describing Israel's
ruin as due to Jehovah's word, Amos asks how could
it have happened otherwise:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Shall horses run up a cliff, or oxen plough the sea? that
ye turn justice into poison, and the fruit of righteousness
into wormwood.</i><a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> A moral order exists, which it is as
impossible to break without disaster as it would be
to break the natural order by driving horses upon
a precipice. There is an inherent necessity in the
sinners' doom. Again, he says of Israel's sin: <i>Shall not
the Land tremble for this? Yea, it shall rise up together
like the Nile, and heave and sink like the Nile of Egypt.</i><a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
The crimes of Israel are so intolerable, that in its own
might the natural frame of things revolts against them.
In these great crises, therefore, as in the simple instances
adduced from everyday life, Amos had a sense of what
we call law, distinct from, and for moments even
overwhelming, that sense of the personal purpose of
God, admission to the secrets of which had marked
his call to be a prophet.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>These instincts we must not exaggerate into a
system. There is no philosophy in Amos, nor need
we wish there were. Far more instructive is what we
do find&mdash;a virgin sense of the sympathy of all things,
the thrill rather than the theory of a universe. And
this faith, which is not a philosophy, is especially
instructive on these two points: that it springs from
the moral sense; and that it embraces, not history only,
but nature.</p>

<p>It springs from the moral sense. Other races have
arrived at a conception of the universe along other
lines: some by the observation of physical laws valid
to the recesses of space; some by logic and the unity
of Reason. But Israel found the universe through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
conscience. It is a historical fact that the Unity of
God, the Unity of History and the Unity of the World,
did, in this order, break upon Israel, through conviction
and experience of the universal sovereignty of righteousness.
We see the beginnings of the process in Amos.
To him the sequences which work themselves out
through history and across nature are moral. Righteousness
is the hinge on which the world hangs;
loosen it, and history and nature feel the shock.
History punishes the sinful nation. But nature, too,
groans beneath the guilt of man; and in the Drought,
the Pestilence and the Earthquake provides his
scourges. It is a belief which has stamped itself
upon the language of mankind. What else is "plague"
than "blow" or "scourge"?</p>

<p>This brings us to the second point&mdash;our prophet's
treatment of Nature.</p>

<p>Apart from the disputed passages (which we shall
take afterwards by themselves) we have in the Book of
Amos few glimpses of nature, and these always under
a moral light. There is not in any chapter a landscape
visible in its own beauty. Like all desert-dwellers,
who when they would praise the works of God lift
their eyes to the heavens, Amos gives us but the
outlines of the earth&mdash;a mountain range,<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> or the
crest of a forest,<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> or the bare back of the land, bent
from sea to sea.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Nearly all his figures are drawn
from the desert&mdash;the torrent, the wild beasts, the
wormwood.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> If he visits the meadows of the shepherds,
it is with the terror of the people's doom;<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> if
the vineyards or orchards, it is with the mildew and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the locust;<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> if the towns, it is with drought, eclipse
and earthquake.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> To him, unlike his fellows, unlike
especially Hosea, the whole land is one theatre of
judgment; but it is a theatre trembling to its foundations
with the drama enacted upon it. Nay, land and
nature are themselves actors in the drama. Physical
forces are inspired with moral purpose, and become
the ministers of righteousness. This is the converse
of Elijah's vision. To the older prophet the message
came that God was not in the fire nor in the earthquake
nor in the tempest, but only in the still small voice.
But to Amos the fire, the earthquake and the tempest
are all in alliance with the Voice, and execute the doom
which it utters. The difference will be appreciated by
us, if we remember the respective problems set to
prophecy in those two periods. To Elijah, prophet
of the elements, wild worker by fire and water, by
life and death, the spiritual had to be asserted and
enforced by itself. Ecstatic as he was, Elijah had to
learn that the Word is more Divine than all physical
violence and terror. But Amos understood that for
his age the question was very different. Not only
was the God of Israel dissociated from the powers
of nature, which were assigned by the popular mind
to the various Ba'alim of the land, so that there was
a divorce between His government of the people and
the influences that fed the people's life; but morality
itself was conceived as provincial. It was narrowed
to the national interests; it was summed up in mere
rules of police, and these were looked upon as not
so important as the observances of the ritual. Therefore
Amos was driven to show that nature and morality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
are one. Morality is not a set of conventions.
"Morality is the order of things." Righteousness
is on the scale of the universe. All things tremble
to the shock of sin; all things work together for good
to them that fear God.</p>

<p>With this sense of law, of moral necessity, in Amos
we must not fail to connect that absence of all appeal
to miracle, which is also conspicuous in his book.</p>

<p>We come now to the three disputed passages:&mdash;</p>

<p>iv. 13:&mdash;<i>For, lo! He Who formed the hills,</i><a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> <i>and
createth the wind,</i><a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> <i>and declareth to man what His</i><a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
<i>mind is; Who maketh the dawn into darkness, and
marcheth on the heights of the land&mdash;Jehovah, God of
Hosts, is His Name.</i></p>

<p>v. 8, 9:&mdash;<i>Maker of the Pleiades and Orion,</i><a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> <i>turning
to morning the murk, and day into night He
darkeneth; Who calleth for the waters of the sea, and
poureth them forth on the face of the earth&mdash;Jehovah His
Name; Who flasheth ruin on the strong, and destruction
cometh down on the fortress.</i><a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>ix. 5, 6:&mdash;<i>And the Lord Jehovah of the Hosts, Who
toucheth the earth and it rocketh, and all mourn that
dwell on it, and it riseth like the Nile together, and sinketh
like the Nile of Egypt; Who hath builded in the heavens
His ascents, and founded His vault upon the earth; Who
calleth to the waters of the sea, and poureth them on the
face of the earth&mdash;Jehovah</i><a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> <i>His Name.</i></p>

<p>These sublime passages it is natural to take as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
triple climax of the doctrine we have traced through
the Book of Amos. Are they not the natural leap of the
soul to the stars? The same shepherd's eye which has
marked sequence and effect unfailing on the desert soil,
does it not now sweep the clear heavens above the
desert, and find there also all things ordered and
arrayed? The same mind which traced the Divine
processes down history, which foresaw the hosts of
Assyria marshalled for Israel's punishment, which felt
the overthrow of justice shock the nation to their ruin,
and read the disasters of the husbandman's year as the
vindication of a law higher than the physical&mdash;does it
not now naturally rise beyond such instances of the
Divine order, round which the dust of history rolls, to
the lofty, undimmed outlines of the Universe as a
whole, and, in consummation of its message, declare
that "all is Law," and Law intelligible to man?</p>

<p>But in the way of so attractive a conclusion the
literary criticism of the book has interposed. It is
maintained<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> that, while none of these sublime verses
are indispensable to the argument of Amos, some of
them actually interrupt it, so that when they are
removed it becomes consistent; that such ejaculations in
praise of Jehovah's creative power are not elsewhere
met with in Hebrew prophecy before the time of the
Exile; that they sound very like echoes of the Book of
Job; and that in the Septuagint version of Hosea we
actually find a similar doxology, wedged into the middle
of an authentic verse of the prophet.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> To these
arguments against the genuineness of the three famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
passages, other critics, not less able and not less free,
like Robertson Smith and Kuenen,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> have replied that
such ejaculations at critical points of the prophet's
discourse "are not surprising under the general conditions
of prophetic oratory"; and that, while one of
the doxologies does appear to break the argument<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> of
the context, they are all of them thoroughly in the spirit
and the style of Amos. To this point the discussion
has been carried; it seems to need a closer
examination.
..
We may at once dismiss the argument which has
been drawn from that obvious intrusion into the Greek
of Hosea xiii. 4. Not only is this verse not so suited
to the doctrine of Hosea as the doxologies are to the
doctrine of Amos; but while they are definite and
sublime, it is formal and flat&mdash;"Who made firm the
heavens and founded the earth, Whose hands founded
all the host of heaven, and He did not display them
that thou shouldest walk after them." The passages
in Amos are vision; this is a piece of catechism
crumbling into homily.</p>

<p>Again&mdash;an argument in favour of the authenticity
of these passages may be drawn from the character
of their subjects. We have seen the part which the
desert played in shaping the temper and the style of
Amos. But the works of the Creator, to which these
passages lift their praise, are just those most fondly
dwelt upon by all the poetry of the desert. The
Arabian nomad, when he magnifies the power of God,
finds his subjects not on the bare earth about him, but
in the brilliant heavens and the heavenly processes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, the critic who affirms that the passages in
Amos "in every case sensibly disturb the connection,"<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
exaggerates. In the case of the first of them, chap. iv.
13, the disturbance is not at all "sensible"; though it
must be admitted that the oracle closes impressively
enough without it. The last of them, chap. ix. 5, 6&mdash;which
repeats a clause already found in the book<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>&mdash;is
as much in sympathy with its context as most of the
oracles in the somewhat scattered discourse of that last
section of the book. The real difficulty is the second
doxology, chap. v. 8, 9, which does break the connection,
and in a sudden and violent way. Remove it, and the
argument is consistent. We cannot read chap. v.
without feeling that, whether Amos wrote these verses
or not, they did not originally stand where they stand
at present.</p>

<p>Now, taken with this dispensableness of two of the
passages and this obvious intrusion of one of them, the
following additional fact becomes ominous. <i>Jehovah is
His Name</i> (which occurs in two of the passages),<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> or
<i>Jehovah of Hosts is His Name</i> (which occurs at least in
one),<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> is a construction which does not happen elsewhere
in the book, except in a verse where it is awkward
and where we have already seen reason to doubt its
genuineness.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> But still more, the phrase does not occur
in any other prophet, till we come down to the oracles
which compose Isaiah xl.-lxvi. Here it happens
thrice&mdash;twice in passages dating from the Exile,<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> and
once in a passage suspected by some to be of still later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
date.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> In the Book of Jeremiah the phrase is found eight
times; but either in passages already on other grounds
judged by many critics to be later than Jeremiah,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> or
where by itself it is probably an intrusion into the text.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
Now is it a mere coincidence that a phrase, which, outside
the Book of Amos, occurs only in writing of the
time of the Exile and in passages considered for other
reasons to be post-exilic insertions&mdash;is it a mere coincidence
that within the Book of Amos it should again
be found only in suspected verses?</p>

<p>There appears to be in this more than a coincidence;
and the present writer cannot but feel a very strong
case against the traditional belief that these doxologies
are original and integral portions of the Book of Amos.
At the same time a case which has failed to convince
critics like Robertson Smith and Kuenen cannot be
considered conclusive, and we are so ignorant of many
of the conditions of prophetic oratory at this period
that dogmatism is impossible. For instance, the use
by Amos of the Divine titles is a matter over which
uncertainty still lingers; and any further argument
on the subject must include a fuller discussion than
space here allows of the remarkable distribution of
those titles throughout the various sections of the
book.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>But if it be not given to us to prove this kind of
authenticity&mdash;a question whose data are so obscure,
yet whose answer fortunately is of so little significance&mdash;let
us gladly welcome that greater Authenticity
whose undeniable proofs these verses so splendidly
exhibit. No one questions their right to the place
which some great spirit gave them in this book&mdash;their
suitableness to its grand and ordered theme, their
pure vision and their eternal truth. That common-sense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and that conscience, which, moving among
the events of earth and all the tangled processes
of history, find everywhere reason and righteousness
at work, in these verses claim the Universe for the
same powers, and see in stars and clouds and the
procession of day and night the One Eternal God Who
<i>declareth to man what His mind is</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE BOOK OF HOSEA</i></h3>


<p>The Book of Hosea consists of two unequal sections,
chaps. i.-iii. and chaps. iv.-xiv., which
differ in the dates of their standpoints, to a large extent
also in the details of their common subjects, but still
more largely in their form and style. The First Section
is in the main narrative; though the style rises to the
pitch of passionate pleading and promise, it is fluent
and equable. If one verse be omitted and three
others transposed,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> the argument is continuous. In
the Second Section, on the contrary, we have a stream
of addresses and reflections, appeals, upbraidings, sarcasms,
recollections of earlier history, denunciations
and promises, which, with little logical connection
and almost no pauses or periods, start impulsively
from each other, and for a large part are expressed
in elliptic and ejaculatory phrases. In the present
restlessness of Biblical Criticism it would have been
surprising if this difference of style had not prompted
some minds to a difference of authorship. Grätz<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> has
distinguished two Hoseas, separated by a period of fifty
years. But if, as we shall see, the First Section reflects
the end of the reign of Jeroboam II., who died about
743, then the next few years, with their revolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
changes in Israel, are sufficient to account for the
altered outlook of the Second Section; while the altered
style is fully explained by difference of occasion and
motive. In both sections not only are the religious
principles identical, and many of the characteristic
expressions,<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> but there breathes throughout the same
urgent and jealous temper, which renders Hosea's
personality so distinctive among the prophets. Within
this unity, of course, we must not be surprised to find,
as in the Book of Amos, verses which cannot well be
authentic.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">First Section: Hosea's Prophetic Life.</span></h4>

<p>With the removal of some of the verses the argument
becomes clear and consecutive. After the story
of the wife and children (i. 2-9), who are symbols of
the land and people of Israel in their apostasy from
God (2, 4, 6, 9), the Divine voice calls on the living
generation to plead with their mother lest destruction
come (ii. 2-5, Eng.; ii. 4-7, Heb.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>), but then passes
definite sentence of desolation on the land and of exile
on the people (6-13, Eng.; 8-15, Heb.), which however
is not final doom, but discipline,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> with the ultimate
promise of the return of the nation's youth, their
renewed betrothal to Jehovah and the restoration of
nature (14-23). Then follows the story of the prophet's
restoration of his wife, also with discipline
(chap. iii.).</p>

<p>Notice that, although the story of the wife's fall
has preceded the declaration of Israel's apostasy, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Israel's restoration which precedes the wife's. The
ethical significance of this order we shall illustrate in
the next chapter.</p>

<p>In this section the disturbing verses are i. 7 and
the group of three&mdash;i. 10, 11, ii. 1 (Eng.; but ii. 1-3
Heb.). Chap. i. 7 introduces Judah as excepted from
the curse passed upon Israel; it is so obviously intrusive
in a prophecy dealing only with Israel, and it so
clearly reflects the deliverance of Judah from Sennacherib
in 701, that we cannot hold it for anything but
an insertion of a date subsequent to that deliverance,
and introduced by a pious Jew to signalise Judah's fate
in contrast with Israel's.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>The other three verses (i. 10, 11, ii. 1, Eng.; ii. 1-3,
Heb.) introduce a promise of restoration before the
sentence of judgment is detailed, or any ethical conditions
of restoration are stated. That is, they break
and tangle an argument otherwise consistent and progressive
from beginning to end of the Section. Every
careful reader must feel them out of place where they
lie. Their awkwardness has been so much appreciated
that, while in the Hebrew text they have
been separated from chap. i., in the Greek they have
been separated from chap. ii. That is to say, some
have felt they have no connection with what precedes
them, others none with what follows them; while our
English version, by distributing them between the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
chapters, only makes more sensible their superfluity.
If they really belong to the prophecy, their proper
place is after the last verse of chap. ii.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> This is
actually the order in which part of it and part of them
are quoted by St. Paul.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> At the same time, when so
arranged, they repeat somewhat awkwardly the language
of ii. 23, and scarcely form a climax to the chapter.
There is nothing in their language to lead us to doubt
that they are Hosea's own; and ver. 11 shows that
they must have been written at least before the captivity
of Northern Israel.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>The only other suspected clause in this section is
that in iii. 5, <i>and David their king</i>;<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> but if it be struck
out the verse is rendered awkward, if not impossible,
by the immediate repetition of the Divine name, which
would not have been required in the absence of the
suspected clause.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>The text of the rest of the section is remarkably
free from obscurities. The Greek version offers few
variants, and most of these are due to mistranslation.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>
In iii. 1 for <i>loved of a husband</i> it reads <i>loving evil</i>.</p>

<p>Evidently this section was written before the death
of Jeroboam II. The house of Jehu still reigns; and
as Hosea predicts its fall by war on the classic battleground
of Jezreel, the prophecy must have been written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
before the actual fall, which took the form of an
internal revolt against Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam.
With this agrees the tone of the section. There are
the same evils in Israel which Amos exposed in the
prosperous years of the same reign; but Hosea appears
to realise the threatened exile from a nearer standpoint.
It is probable also that part of the reason of his ability
to see his way through the captivity to the people's
restoration is due to a longer familiarity with the
approach of captivity than Amos experienced before he
wrote. But, of course, for Hosea's promise of restoration
there were, as we shall see, other and greater reasons of
a religious kind.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Second Section: Chaps.</span> iv.-xiv.</h4>

<p>When we pass into these chapters we feel that the
times are changed. The dynasty of Jehu has passed:
kings are falling rapidly: Israel devours its rulers:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
there is no loyalty to the king; he is suddenly cut off;<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
all the princes are revolters.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Round so despised and
so unstable a throne the nation tosses in disorder.
Conspiracies are rife. It is not only, as in Amos, the
the sins of the luxurious, of them that are at ease in
Zion, which are exposed; but also literal bloodshed:
highway robbery with murder, abetted by the priests;<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
the thief breaketh in and the robber-troop maketh a
raid.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Amos looked out on foreign nations across a quiet
Israel; his views of the world are wide and clear; but
in the Book of Hosea the dust is up, and into what is
happening beyond the frontier we get only glimpses.
There is enough, however, to make visible another great
change since the days of Jeroboam. Israel's self-reliance
is gone. She is as fluttered as a startled bird:
<i>They call unto Egypt, they go unto Assyria.</i><a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Their
wealth is carried as a gift to King Jareb,<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> and they
evidently engage in intrigues with Egypt. But everything
is hopeless: kings cannot save, for Ephraim is
seized by the pangs of a fatal crisis.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>This broken description reflects&mdash;and all the more
faithfully because of its brokenness&mdash;the ten years
which followed on the death of Jeroboam II. about
743.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> His son Zechariah, who succeeded him, was
in six months assassinated by Shallum ben Jabesh,
who within a month more was himself cut down by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Menahem ben Gadi.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Menahem held the throne for
six or seven years, but only by sending to the King
of Assyria an enormous tribute which he exacted
from the wealthy magnates of Israel.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Discontent
must have followed these measures, such discontent
with their rulers as Hosea describes. Pekahiah
ben Menahem kept the throne for little over a year
after his father's death, and was assassinated by his
captain,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Pekah ben Remaliah, with fifty Gileadites,
and Pekah took the throne about 736. This second
and bloody usurpation may be one of those on which
Hosea dwells; but if so it is the last historical allusion
in his book. There is no reference to the war of
Pekah and Rezin against Ahaz of Judah which Isaiah
describes,<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> and to which Hosea must have alluded had
he been still prophesying.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> There is no allusion to
its consequence in Tiglath-Pileser's conquest of Gilead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and Galilee in 734-733. On the contrary, these
provinces are still regarded as part of the body politic
of Israel.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> Nor is there any sign that Israel have
broken with Assyria; to the last the book represents
them as fawning on the Northern Power.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>In all probability, then, the Book of Hosea was
closed before 734 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The Second Section dates
from the years behind that and back to the death of
Jeroboam II. about 743, while the First Section, as we
saw, reflects the period immediately before the latter.</p>

<p>We come now to the general style of chaps. iv.-xiv.
The period, as we have seen, was one of the most
broken of all the history of Israel; the political outlook,
the temper of the people, were constantly changing.
Hosea, who watched these kaleidoscopes, had himself
an extraordinarily mobile and vibrant mind. There
could be no greater contrast to that fixture of conscience
which renders the Book of Amos so simple in argument,
so firm in style.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> It was a leaden plummet
which Amos saw Jehovah setting to the structure of
Israel's life.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> But Hosea felt his own heart hanging
at the end of the line; and this was a heart that could
never be still. Amos is the prophet of law; he sees the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Divine processes work themselves out, irrespective of the
moods and intrigues of the people, with which, after all,
he was little familiar. So each of his paragraphs moves
steadily forward to a climax, and every climax is Doom&mdash;the
captivity of the people to Assyria. You can
divide his book by these things; it has its periods,
strophes and refrains. It marches like the hosts of
the Lord of hosts. But Hosea had no such unhampered
vision of great laws. He was too familiar
with the rapid changes of his fickle people; and his
affection for them was too anxious. His style has
all the restlessness and irritableness of hunger about
it&mdash;the hunger of love. Hosea's eyes are never at
rest. He seeks, he welcomes, for moments of extraordinary
fondness he dwells upon every sign of his
people's repentance. But a Divine jealousy succeeds,
and he questions the motives of the change. You feel
that his love has been overtaken and surprised by his
knowledge; and in fact his whole style might be
described as a race between the two&mdash;a race varying
and uncertain up to almost the end. The transitions
are very swift. You come upon a passage of exquisite
tenderness: the prophet puts the people's penitence in
his own words with a sympathy and poetry that are
sublime and seem final. But suddenly he remembers
how false they are, and there is another light in his
eyes. The lustre of their tears dies from his verses,
like the dews of a midsummer morning in Ephraim;
and all is dry and hard again beneath the brazen sun
of his amazement. <i>What shall I do unto thee, Ephraim?
What shall I do unto thee, Judah?</i> Indeed, this figure
of his own is insufficient to express the suddenness
with which Hosea lights up some intrigue of the statesmen
of the day, or some evil habit of the priests, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
some hidden orgy of the common people. Rather than
the sun it is the lightning&mdash;the lightning in pursuit of
a serpent.</p>

<p>The elusiveness of the style is the greater that many
passages do not seem to have been prepared for public
delivery. They are more the play of the prophet's
mind than his set speech. They are not formally
addressed to an audience, and there is no trace in
them of oratorical art.</p>

<p>Hence the language of this Second Section of the
Book of Hosea is impulsive and abrupt beyond all
comparison. There is little rhythm in it, and almost
no argument. Few metaphors are elaborated. Even
the brief parallelism of Hebrew poetry seems too long
for the quick spasms of the writer's heart. "Osee,"
said Jerome,<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> "commaticus est, et quasi per sententias
loquitur." He speaks in little clauses, often broken
off; he is impatient even of copulas. And withal he
uses a vocabulary full of strange words, which the
paucity of parallelism makes much the more difficult.</p>

<p>To this original brokenness and obscurity of the
language are due, <i>first</i>, the great corruption of the text;
<i>second</i>, the difficulty of dividing it; <i>third</i>, the uncertainty
of deciding its genuineness or authenticity.</p>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Text</span> of Hosea is one of the most dilapidated
in the Old Testament, and in parts beyond possibility
of repair. It is probable that glosses were found necessary
at an earlier period and to a larger extent than in
most other books: there are evident traces of some;
yet it is not always possible to disentangle them.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> The
value of the Greek version is curiously mixed. The
authors had before them much the same difficulties as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
we have, and they made many more for themselves.
Some of their mistranslations are outrageous: they
occur not only in obscure passages, where they may
be pardoned;<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> but even where there are parallel terms
with which the translators show themselves familiar.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
Sometimes they have translated word by word, without
any attempt to give the general sense; and as a whole
their version is devoid both of beauty and compactness.
Yet not infrequently they supply us with a better reading
than the Massoretic text. Occasionally they divide
words properly which the latter misdivides.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> They
often give more correctly the easily confused pronominal
suffixes;<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> and the copula.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> And they help us to the
true readings of many other words.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Here and there
an additional clause in the Greek is plethoric, perhaps
copied by mistake from a similar verse in the context.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
All of these will be noticed separately as we reach them.
But, even after these and other aids, we shall find that
the text not infrequently remains impracticable.</p>

<p>2. As great as the difficulty of reaching a true text<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
in this Second Section of the book is the difficulty of
<span class="smcap">Dividing</span> it. Here and there, it is true, the Greek helps
us to improve upon the division into chapters and
verses of the Hebrew text, which is that of our own
English version. Chap. vi. 1-4 ought to follow immediately
on to the end of chap. v., with the connecting
word <i>saying</i>. The last few words of chap. vi. go with
the first two of chap. vii., but perhaps both are gloss.
The openings of chaps. xi. and xii. are better arranged
in the Hebrew than in the Greek. As regards verses
we shall have to make several rearrangements.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> But
beyond this more or less conventional division into
chapters and verses our confidence ceases. It is impossible
to separate the section, long as it is, into subsections,
or into oracles, strophes or periods. The
reason of this we have already seen, in the turbulence
of the period reflected, in the divided interests and abrupt
and emotional style of the author, and in the probability
that part at least of the book was not prepared for
public speaking. The periods and climaxes, the
refrains, the catchwords by which we are helped to
divide even the confused Second Section of the Book
of Amos, are not found in Hosea. Only twice does the
exordium of a spoken address occur: at the beginning
of the section (chap. iv. 1), and at what is now the opening
of the next chapter (v. 1). The phrase <i>'tis the oracle
of Jehovah</i>, which occurs so periodically in Amos, and
thrice in the second chapter of Hosea, is found only
once in chaps. iv.-xiv. Again, the obvious climaxes or
perorations, of which we found so many in Amos, are
very few,<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> and even when they occur the next verses
start impulsively from them, without a pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of these difficulties, since the section is so
long, attempts at division have been made. Ewald
distinguished three parts in three different tempers:
<i>First</i>, iv.-vi. 11 <i>a</i>, God's Plaint against His people;
<i>Second</i>, vi. 11 <i>b</i>-ix. 9, Their Punishment; <i>Third</i>, ix. 10-xiv.
10, Retrospect of the earlier history&mdash;warning
and consolation. Driver also divides into three subsections,
but differently: <i>First</i>, iv.-viii., in which
Israel's Guilt predominates; <i>Second</i>, ix.-xi. 11, in
which the prevailing thought is their Punishment;
<i>Third</i>, xi. 12-xiv. 10, in which both lines of thought
are continued, but followed by a glance at the brighter
future.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> What is common to both these arrangements
is the recognition of a certain progress from feelings
about Israel's guilt which prevail in the earlier chapters,
to a clear vision of the political destruction
awaiting them; and finally more hope of repentance
in the people, with a vision of the blessed future that
must follow upon it. It is, however, more accurate to
say that the emphasis of Hosea's prophesying, instead
of changing from the Guilt to the Punishment of Israel,
changes about the middle of chap. vii. from their Moral
Decay to their Political Decay, and that the description
of the latter is modified or interrupted by Two Visions
of better things: one of Jehovah's early guidance of the
people, with a great outbreak of His Love upon them, in
chap. xi.; and one of their future Return to Jehovah
and restoration in chap. xiv. It is on these features
that the division of the following Exposition is arranged.</p>

<p>3. It will be obvious that with a text so corrupt,
with a style so broken and incapable of logical division,
questions of <span class="smcap">Authenticity</span> are raised to a pitch of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
greatest difficulty. Allusion has been made to the
number of glosses which must have been found necessary
from even an early period, and of some of which
we can discern the proofs.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> We will deal with these
as they occur. But we may here discuss, as a whole,
another class of suspected passages&mdash;suspected for the
same reason that we saw a number in Amos to be,
because of their reference to Judah. In the Book of
Hosea (chaps. iv.-xiv.) they are twelve in number.
Only one of them is favourable (iv. 15): <i>Though Israel
play the harlot, let not Judah sin.</i> Kuenen<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> argues that
this is genuine, on the ground that the peculiar verb
<i>to sin</i> or <i>take guilt to oneself</i> is used several other
times in the book,<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> and that the wish expressed is in
consonance with what he understands to be Hosea's
favourable feeling towards Judah. Yet Hosea nowhere
else makes any distinction between Ephraim and Judah
in the matter of sin, but condemns both equally; and as
iv. 15 f. are to be suspected on other grounds as well,
I cannot hold this reference to Judah to be beyond
doubt. Nor is the reference in viii. 14 genuine: <i>And
Israel forgat her Maker and built temples, and Judah
multiplied fenced cities, but I will send fire on his cities
and it shall devour her palaces</i>. Kuenen<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> refuses to
reject the reference to Judah, on the ground that
without it the rhythm of the verse is spoiled; but the
fact is the whole verse must go. Chap. v. 13 forms a
climax, which v. 14 only weakens; the style is not like
Hosea's own, and indeed is but an echo of verses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Amos.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> Nor can we be quite sure about v. 5: <i>Israel
and Ephraim shall stumble by their iniquities, and</i> (LXX.)
<i>stumble also shall Judah with them</i>; or vi. 10, 11: <i>In
Bethel I have seen horrors: there playest thou the harlot,
Ephraim; there Israel defiles himself; also Judah</i> ...
(the rest of the text is impracticable). In both these
passages Judah is the awkward third of a parallelism,
and is introduced by an <i>also</i>, as if an afterthought.
Yet the afterthought may be the prophet's own; for
in other passages, to which no doubt attaches, he fully
includes Judah in the sinfulness of Israel. Cornill
rejects x. 11, <i>Judah must plough</i>, but I cannot see on
what grounds; as Kuenen says, it has no appearance
of being an intrusion.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> In xii. 3 Wellhausen reads
<i>Israel</i> for <i>Judah</i>, but the latter is justified if not rendered
necessary by the reference to Judah in ver. 1, which
Wellhausen admits. Against the other references&mdash;v.
10, <i>The princes of Judah are as removers of
boundaries</i>; v. 12, <i>I shall be as the moth to Ephraim,
and a worm to the house of Judah</i>; v. 13, <i>And Ephraim
saw his disease, and Judah his sore</i>; v. 14, <i>For I am as
a roaring lion to Ephraim, and as a young lion to the
house of Judah</i>; vi. 4, <i>What shall I do to thee, Ephraim?
what shall I do to thee, Judah?</i>&mdash;there are no apparent
objections; and they are generally admitted by critics.
As Kuenen says, it would have been surprising if Hosea
had made no reference to the sister kingdom. His
judgment of her is amply justified by that of her own
citizens, Isaiah and Micah.</p>

<p>Other short passages of doubtful authenticity will
be treated as we come to them; but again it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
emphasised that, in a book of such a style as this,
certainty on the subject is impossible.</p>

<p>Finally, there may be given here the only notable
addition which the Septuagint makes to the Book of
Hosea. It occurs in xiii. 4, after <i>I am Jehovah thy
God</i>: "That made fast the heavens and founded the
earth, whose hands founded all the host of the heaven,
and I did not show them to thee that thou shouldest
follow after them, and I led thee up"&mdash;<i>from the land of
Egypt</i>.</p>

<p>At first this recalls those apostrophes to Jehovah's
power which break forth in the Book of Amos; and
the resemblance has been taken to prove that they
also are late intrusions. But this both obtrudes itself
as they do not, and is manifestly of much lower
poetical value. See page <a href="#Page_203">203</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now our material clearly before us, and
may proceed to the more welcome task of tracing our
prophet's life, and expounding his teaching.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE PROBLEM THAT AMOS LEFT</i></h3>


<p>Amos was a preacher of righteousness almost
wholly in its judicial and punitive offices. Exposing
the moral conditions of society in his day,
emphasising on the one hand its obduracy and on
the other the intolerableness of it, he asserted that
nothing could avert the inevitable doom&mdash;neither
Israel's devotion to Jehovah nor Jehovah's interest
in Israel. <i>You alone have I known of all the families
of the ground: therefore will I visit upon you all your
iniquities.</i> The visitation was to take place in war
and in the captivity of the people. This is practically
the whole message of the prophet Amos.</p>

<p>That he added to it the promise of restoration which
now closes his book, we have seen to be extremely
improbable.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Yet even if that promise is his own,
Amos does not tell us how the restoration is to be
brought about. With wonderful insight and patience
he has traced the captivity of Israel to moral causes.
But he does not show what moral change in the exiles
is to justify their restoration, or by what means such
a moral change is to be effected. We are left to infer
the conditions and the means of redemption from the
principles which Amos enforced while there yet seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
time to pray for the doomed people: <i>Seek the Lord and
ye shall live</i>.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> According to this, the moral renewal of
Israel must precede their restoration; but the prophet
seems to make no great effort to effect the renewal.
In short Amos illustrates the easily-forgotten truth
that a preacher to the conscience is not necessarily a
preacher of repentance.</p>

<p>Of the great antitheses between which religion
moves, Law and Love, Amos had therefore been the
prophet of Law. But we must not imagine that the
association of Love with the Deity was strange to him.
This could not be to any Israelite who remembered the
past of his people&mdash;the romance of their origins and
early struggles for freedom. Israel had always felt the
grace of their God; and, unless we be wrong about
the date of the great poem in the end of Deuteronomy,
they had lately celebrated that grace in lines of
exquisite beauty and tenderness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>He found him in a desert land,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>In a waste and a howling wilderness.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He compassed him about, cared for him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Kept him as the apple of His eye.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As an eagle stirreth up his nest,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Fluttereth over his young,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Spreadeth his wings, taketh them,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Beareth them up on his pinions&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>So Jehovah alone led him.</i><a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The patience of the Lord with their waywardness
and their stubbornness had been the ethical influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
on Israel's life at a time when they had probably
neither code of law nor system of doctrine. <i>Thy
gentleness</i>, as an early Psalmist says for his people,
<i>Thy gentleness hath made me great</i>.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Amos is not
unaware of this ancient grace of Jehovah. But he
speaks of it in a fashion which shows that he feels
it to be exhausted and without hope for his generation.
<i>I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and
led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the
land of the Amorites. And I raised up of your sons
for prophets and of your young men for Nazirites.</i><a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
But this can now only fill the cup of the nation's
sin. <i>You alone have I known of all the families of the
earth: therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities.</i><a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
Jehovah's ancient Love but strengthens now the justice
and the impetus of His Law.</p>

<p>We perceive, then, the problem which Amos left to
prophecy. It was not to discover Love in the Deity
whom he had so absolutely identified with Law. The
Love of God needed no discovery among a people with
the Deliverance, the Exodus, the Wilderness and the
Gift of the Land in their memories. But the problem
was to prove in God so great and new a mercy as was
capable of matching that Law, which the abuse of His
millennial gentleness now only the more fully justified.
There was needed a prophet to arise with as keen a
conscience of Law as Amos himself, and yet affirm
that Love was greater still; to admit that Israel were
doomed, and yet promise their redemption by processes
as reasonable and as ethical as those by which the doom
had been rendered inevitable. The prophet of Conscience
had to be followed by the prophet of Repentance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>Such an one was found in Hosea, the son of
Be'eri, a citizen and probably a priest of Northern
Israel, whose very name, <i>Salvation</i>, the synonym of
Joshua and of Jesus, breathed the larger hope, which
it was his glory to bear to his people. Before we
see how for this task Hosea was equipped with the
love and sympathy which Amos lacked, let us do two
things. Let us appreciate the magnitude of the task
itself, set to him first of prophets; and let us remind
ourselves that, greatly as he achieved it, the task was not
one which could be achieved even by him once for all,
but that it presents itself to religion again and again in
the course of her development.</p>

<p>For the first of these duties, it is enough to recall
how much all subsequent prophecy derives from Hosea.
We shall not exaggerate if we say that there is no
truth uttered by later prophets about the Divine Grace,
which we do not find in germ in him. Isaiah of
Jerusalem was a greater statesman and a more powerful
writer, but he had not Hosea's tenderness and insight
into motive and character. Hosea's marvellous sympathy
both with the people and with God is sufficient
to foreshadow every grief, every hope, every gospel,
which make the books of Jeremiah and the great
Prophet of the Exile exhaustless in their spiritual value
for mankind. Those others explored the kingdom
of God: it was Hosea who took it by storm.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> He is
the first prophet of Grace, Israel's earliest Evangelist;
yet with as keen a sense of law, and of the inevitableness
of ethical discipline, as Amos himself.</p>

<p>But the task which Hosea accomplished was not one
that could be accomplished once for all. The interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
of his book is not merely historical. For so often as
a generation is shocked out of its old religious ideals,
as Amos shocked Israel, by a realism and a discovery
of law, which have no respect for ideals, however ancient
and however dear to the human heart, but work their
own pitiless way to doom inevitable; so often must the
Book of Hosea have a practical value for living men.
At such a crisis we stand to-day. The older Evangelical
assurance, the older Evangelical ideals have to
some extent been rendered impossible by the realism
to which the sciences, both physical and historical, have
most healthily recalled us, and by their wonderful
revelation of Law working through nature and society
without respect to our creeds and pious hopes. The
question presses: Is it still possible to believe in
repentance and conversion, still possible to preach the
power of God to save, whether the individual or society,
from the forces of heredity and of habit? We can at
least learn how Hosea mastered the very similar problem
which Amos left to him, and how, with a moral
realism no less stern than his predecessor and a moral
standard every whit as high, he proclaimed Love to be
the ultimate element in religion; not only because it
moves man to a repentance and God to a redemption
more sovereign than any law; but because if neglected
or abused, whether as love of man or love of God, it
enforces a doom still more inexorable than that required
by violated truth or by outraged justice. Love our
Saviour, Love our almighty and unfailing Father, but,
just because of this, Love our most awful Judge&mdash;we
turn to the life and the message in which this eternal
theme was first unfolded.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE STORY OF THE PRODIGAL WIFE</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> i.-iii.</h5>


<p>It has often been remarked that, unlike the first
Doomster of Israel, Israel's first Evangelist was
one of themselves, a native and citizen, perhaps even
a priest, of the land to which he was sent. This
appears even in his treatment of the stage and soil of
his ministry. Contrast him in this respect with Amos.</p>

<p>In the Book of Amos we have few glimpses of the
scenery of Israel, and these always by flashes of
the lightnings of judgment: the towns in drought or
earthquake or siege; the vineyards and orchards under
locusts or mildew; Carmel itself desolate, or as a
hiding-place from God's wrath.</p>

<p>But Hosea's love steals across his whole land like
the dew, provoking every separate scent and colour,
till all Galilee lies before us, lustrous and fragrant as
nowhere else outside the parables of Jesus. The Book
of Amos, when it would praise God's works, looks to
the stars. But the poetry of Hosea clings about his
native soil like its trailing vines. If he appeals to the
heavens, it is only that they may speak to the earth,
and the earth to the corn and the wine, and the corn and
the wine to Jezreel.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Even the wild beasts&mdash;and Hosea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
tells us of their cruelty almost as much as Amos&mdash;he
cannot shut out of the hope of his love: <i>I will make
a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with
the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the
ground</i>.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> God's love-gifts to His people are corn and
wool, flax and oil; while spiritual blessings are figured
in the joys of them who sow and reap. With Hosea
we feel all the seasons of the Syrian year: early
rain and latter rain, the first flush of the young corn,
the scent of the vine blossom, the <i>first ripe fig of the
fig-tree in her first season</i>, the bursting of the lily; the
wild vine trailing on the hedge, the field of tares,
the beauty of the full olive in sunshine and breeze;
the mists and heavy dews of a summer morning in
Ephraim, the night winds laden with the air of the
mountains, <i>the scent of Lebanon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> Or it is the dearer
human sights in valley and field: the smoke from the
chimney, the chaff from the threshing-floor, the doves
startled to their towers, the fowler and his net; the
breaking up of the fallow ground, the harrowing of the
clods, the reapers, the heifer that treadeth out the corn;
the team of draught oxen surmounting the steep road,
and at the top the kindly driver setting in food to their
jaws.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>Where, I say, do we find anything like this save
in the parables of Jesus? For the love of Hosea was
as the love of that greater Galilean: however high,
however lonely it soared, it was yet rooted in the
common life below, and fed with the unfailing grace
of a thousand homely sources.</p>

<p>But just as the Love which first showed itself in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
sunny Parables of Galilee passed onward to Gethsemane
and the Cross, so the love of Hosea, that had wakened
with the spring lilies and dewy summer mornings of
the North, had also, ere his youth was spent, to
meet its agony and shame. These came upon the
prophet in his home, and in her in whom so loyal
and tender a heart had hoped to find his chiefest
sanctuary next to God. There are, it is true, some of
the ugliest facts of human life about this prophet's
experience; but the message is one very suited to our
own hearts and times. Let us read this story of the
Prodigal Wife as we do that other Galilean tale of the
Prodigal Son. There as well as here are harlots; but
here as well as there is the clear mirror of the Divine
Love. For the Bible never shuns realism when it
would expose the exceeding hatefulness of sin or
magnify the power of God's love to redeem. To an
age which is always treating conjugal infidelity either
as a matter of comedy or as a problem of despair, the
tale of Hosea and his wife may still become, what it
proved to his own generation, a gospel full of love
and hope.</p>

<p>The story, and how it led Hosea to understand
God's relations to sinful men, is told in the first three
chapters of his book. It opens with the very startling
sentence: <i>The beginning of the word of Jehovah to
Hosea:&mdash;And Jehovah said to Hosea, Go, take thee a wife
of harlotry and children of harlotry: for the Land hath
committed great harlotry in departing from Jehovah.</i><a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>The command was obeyed. <i>And he went and took
Gomer, daughter of Diblaim;</i><a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> <i>and she conceived, and bare</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
<i>to him a son. And Jehovah said unto him, Call his
name Jezreel; for yet a little and I shall visit the blood of
Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will bring to an end
the kingdom of the house of Israel; and it shall be on
that day that I shall break the bow of Israel in the Vale
of Jezreel</i>&mdash;the classic battle-field of Israel.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> <i>And she
conceived again, and bare a daughter; and He said to
him, Call her name Un-Loved</i>, or <i>That-never-knew-a-Father's-Pity;</i><a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>
<i>for I will not again have pity</i>&mdash;such pity
as a Father hath&mdash;<i>on the house of Israel, that I should
fully forgive them.</i><a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> <i>And she weaned Un-Pitied, and
conceived, and bare a son. And He said, Call his name</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
<i>Not-My-People; for ye are not My people, and I&mdash;I am
not yours.</i><a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>It is not surprising that divers interpretations have
been put upon this troubled tale. The words which
introduce it are so startling that very many have held
it to be an allegory, or parable, invented by the
prophet to illustrate, by familiar human figures, what
was at that period the still difficult conception of the
Love of God for sinful men. But to this well-intended
argument there are insuperable objections. It implies
that Hosea had first awakened to the relations of
Jehovah and Israel&mdash;He faithful and full of affection,
she unfaithful and thankless&mdash;and that then, in order
to illustrate the relations, he had invented the story.
To that we have an adequate reply. In the first place,
though it were possible, it is extremely improbable,
that such a man should have invented such a tale
about his wife, or, if he was unmarried, about himself.
But, in the second place, he says expressly that his
domestic experience was the <i>beginning of Jehovah's
word to him</i>. That is, he passed through it first, and
only afterwards, with the sympathy and insight thus
acquired, he came to appreciate Jehovah's relation to
Israel. Finally, the style betrays narrative rather than
parable. The simple facts are told; there is an
absence of elaboration; there is no effort to make
every detail symbolic; the names Gomer and Diblaim
are apparently those of real persons; every attempt to
attach a symbolic value to them has failed.</p>

<p>She was, therefore, no dream, this woman, but flesh
and blood: the sorrow, the despair, the sphinx of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
prophet's life; yet a sphinx who in the end yielded
her riddle to love.</p>

<p>Accordingly a large number of other interpreters
have taken the story throughout as the literal account
of actual facts. This is the theory of many of the
Latin and Greek Fathers,<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> of many of the Puritans
and of Dr. Pusey&mdash;by one of those agreements into
which, from such opposite schools, all these commentators
are not infrequently drawn by their common
captivity to the letter of Scripture.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> When you ask
them, How then do you justify that first strange word
of God to Hosea,<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> if you take it literally and believe
that Hosea was charged to marry a woman of public
shame? they answer either that such an evil may be
justified by the bare word of God, or that it was well
worth the end, the salvation of a lost soul.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> And
indeed this tragedy would be invested with an even
greater pathos if it were true that the human hero
had passed through a self-sacrifice so unusual, had
incurred such a shame for such an end. The interpretation,
however, seems forbidden by the essence
of the story. Had not Hosea's wife been pure when
he married her she could not have served as a type
of the Israel whose earliest relations to Jehovah he
describes as innocent. And this is confirmed by other
features of the book: by the high ideal which Hosea
has of marriage, and by that sense of early goodness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
and early beauty passing away like morning mist,
which is so often and so pathetically expressed that
we cannot but catch in it the echo of his own experience.
As one has said to whom we owe, more than
to any other, the exposition of the gospel in Hosea,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>
"The struggle of Hosea's shame and grief when he
found his wife unfaithful is altogether inconceivable
unless his first love had been pure and full of trust
in the purity of its object."</p>

<p>How then are we to reconcile with this the statement
of that command to take a wife of the character
so frankly described? In this way&mdash;and we owe the
interpretation to the same lamented scholar.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> When,
some years after his marriage, Hosea at last began
to be aware of the character of her whom he had
taken to his home, and while he still brooded upon
it, God revealed to him why He who knoweth all
things from the beginning had suffered His servant
to marry such a woman; and Hosea, by a very natural
anticipation, in which he is imitated by other prophets,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
pushed back his own knowledge of God's purpose
to the date when that purpose began actually to be
fulfilled, the day of his betrothal. This, though he
was all unconscious of its fatal future, had been to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Hosea the beginning of the word of the Lord. On
that uncertain voyage he had sailed with sealed
orders.</p>

<p>Now this is true to nature, and may be matched
from our own experience. "The beginning of God's
word" to any of us&mdash;where does it lie? Does it
lie in the first time the meaning of our life became
articulate, and we were able to utter it to others? Ah
no; it always lies far behind that, in facts and in
relationships, of the Divine meaning of which we are
at the time unconscious, though now we know. How
familiar this is in respect to the sorrows and adversities
of life: dumb, deadening things that fall on us at the
time with no more voice than clods falling on coffins
of dead men, we have been able to read them afterwards
as the clear call of God to our souls. But what
we thus so readily admit about the sorrows of life may
be equally true of any of those relations which we
enter with light and unawed hearts, conscious only of
the novelty and the joy of them. It is most true of
the love which meets a man as it met Hosea in his
opening manhood.</p>

<p>How long Hosea took to discover his shame he
indicates by a few hints which he suffers to break from
the delicate reserve of his story. He calls the first
child his own; and the boy's name, though ominous of
the nation's fate, has no trace of shame upon it. Hosea's
Jezreel was as Isaiah's Shear-Jashub or Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
But Hosea does not claim the second child;
and in the name of this little lass, Lo-Ruhamah, <i>she-that-never-knew-a-father's-love</i>,
orphan not by death
but by her mother's sin, we find proof of the prophet's
awakening to the tragedy of his home. Nor does he
own the third child, named <i>Not-my-people</i>, that could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
also mean <i>No-kin-of-mine</i>. The three births must have
taken at least six years;<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> and once at least, but probably
oftener, Hosea had forgiven the woman, and till
the sixth year she stayed in his house. Then either
he put her from him, or she went her own way. She
sold herself for money, and finally drifted, like all of
her class, into slavery.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>Such were the facts of Hosea's grief, and we have
now to attempt to understand how that grief became
his gospel. We may regard the stages of the process
as two: first, when he was led to feel that his sorrow
was the sorrow of the whole nation; and, second, when
he comprehended that it was of similar kind to the
sorrow of God Himself.</p>

<p>While Hosea brooded upon his pain one of the first
things he would remember would be the fact, which he
so frequently illustrates, that the case of his home was
not singular, but common and characteristic of his
day. Take the evidence of his book, and there must
have been in Israel many such wives as his own. He
describes their sin as the besetting sin of the nation,
and the plague of Israel's life. But to lose your own
sorrow in the vaster sense of national trouble&mdash;that
is the first consciousness of a duty and a mission. In
the analogous vice of intemperance among ourselves
we have seen the same experience operate again and
again. How many a man has joined the public warfare
against that sin, because he was aroused to its
national consequences by the ruin it had brought to
his own home! And one remembers from recent years
a more illustrious instance, where a domestic grief&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
is true of a very different kind&mdash;became not dissimilarly
the opening of a great career of service to
the people:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was in Leamington, and Mr. Cobden called on me. I was
then in the depths of grief&mdash;I may almost say of despair, for the
light and sunshine of my house had been extinguished. All that
was left on earth of my young wife, except the memory of a
sainted life and a too brief happiness, was lying still and cold in
the chamber above us. Mr. Cobden called on me as his friend,
and addressed me, as you may suppose, with words of condolence.
After a time he looked up and said: 'There are thousands
and thousands of homes in England at this moment where
wives and mothers and children are dying of hunger. Now,
when the first paroxysm of your grief is passed, I would advise
you to come with me, and we will never rest until the Corn Laws
are repealed.'"<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Not dissimilarly was Hosea's pain overwhelmed by
the pain of his people. He remembered that there
were in Israel thousands of homes like his own.
Anguish gave way to sympathy. The mystery became
the stimulus to a mission.</p>

<p>But, again, Hosea traces this sin of his day to the
worship of strange gods. He tells the fathers of Israel,
for instance, that they need not be surprised at the
corruption of their wives and daughters when they
themselves bring home from the heathen rites the
infection of light views of love.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> That is to say, the
many sins against human love in Israel, the wrong
done to his own heart in his own home, Hosea connects
with the wrong done to the Love of God, by His
people's desertion of Him for foreign and impure rites.
Hosea's own sorrow thus became a key to the sorrow
of God. Had he loved this woman, cherished and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
honoured her, borne with and forgiven her, only to
find at the last his love spurned and hers turned to
sinful men: so also had the Love of God been treated
by His chosen people, and they had fallen to the loose
worship of idols.</p>

<p>Hosea was the more naturally led to compare his
relations to his wife with Jehovah's to Israel, by
certain religious beliefs current among the Semitic
peoples. It was common to nearly all Semitic religions
to express the union of a god with his land or with his
people by the figure of marriage. The title which
Hosea so often applies to the heathen deities, Ba'al,
meant originally not "lord" of his worshippers, but
"possessor" and endower of his land, its husband and
fertiliser. A fertile land was "a land of Ba'al," or
"Be'ulah," that is, "possessed" or "blessed by a Ba'al."<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>
Under the fertility was counted not only the increase
of field and flock, but the human increase as well;
and thus a nation could speak of themselves as the
children of the Land, their mother, and of her Ba'al,
their father.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> When Hosea, then, called Jehovah the
husband of Israel, it was not an entirely new symbol
which he invented. Up to his time, however, the
marriage of Heaven and Earth, of a god and his people,
seems to have been conceived in a physical form which
ever tended to become more gross; and was expressed,
as Hosea points out, by rites of a sensual and debasing
nature, with the most disastrous effects on the domestic
morals of the people. By an inspiration, whose ethical
character is very conspicuous, Hosea breaks the physical
connection altogether. Jehovah's Bride is not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Land, but the People, and His marriage with her is
conceived wholly as a moral relation. Not that He
has no connection with the physical fruits of the land:
corn, wine, oil, wool and flax. But these are represented
only as the signs and ornaments of the marriage,
love-gifts from the husband to the wife.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> The marriage
itself is purely moral: <i>I will betroth her to Me in righteousness
and justice, in leal love and tender mercies</i>.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
From her in return are demanded faithfulness and
growing knowledge of her Lord.</p>

<p>It is the re-creation of an Idea. Slain and made
carrion by the heathen religions, the figure is restored
to life by Hosea. And this is a life everlasting.
Prophet and apostle, the Israel of Jehovah, the Church
of Christ, have alike found in Hosea's figure an unfailing
significance and charm. Here we cannot trace
the history of the figure; but at least we ought to
emphasise the creative power which its recovery to
life proves to have been inherent in prophecy. This
is one of those triumphs of which the God of Israel
said: <i>Behold, I make all things new</i>.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>Having dug his figure from the mire and set it upon
the rock, Hosea sends it on its way with all boldness.
If Jehovah be thus the husband of Israel, <i>her first
husband, the husband of her youth</i>, then all her pursuit
of the Ba'alim is unfaithfulness to her marriage vows.
But she is worse than an adulteress; she is a harlot. She
has fallen for gifts. Here the historical facts wonderfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
assisted the prophet's metaphor. It was a fact
that Israel and Jehovah were first wedded in the
wilderness upon conditions, which by the very circumstances
of desert life could have little or no reference
to the fertility of the earth, but were purely personal
and moral. And it was also a fact that Israel's declension
from Jehovah came after her settlement in Canaan,
and was due to her discovery of other deities, in possession
of the soil, and adored by the natives as the
dispensers of its fertility. Israel fell under these
superstitions, and, although she still formally acknowledged
her bond to Jehovah, yet in order to get her
fields blessed and her flocks made fertile, her orchards
protected from blight and her fleeces from scab, she
went after the local Ba'alim.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> With bitter scorn Hosea
points out that there was no true love in this: it was
the mercenariness of a harlot, selling herself for gifts.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
And it had the usual results. The children whom
Israel bore were not her husband's.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The new generation
in Israel grew up in ignorance of Jehovah, with
characters and lives strange to His Spirit. They were
Lo-Ruhamah: He could not feel towards them such
pity as a father hath.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> They were Lo-Ammi: not at
all His people. All was in exact parallel to Hosea's
own experience with his wife; and only the real pain
of that experience could have made the man brave
enough to use it as a figure of his God's treatment
by Israel.</p>

<p>Following out the human analogy, the next step
should have been for Jehovah to divorce His erring
spouse. But Jehovah reveals to the prophet that this
is not His way. For He is <i>God and not man, the Holy</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
<i>One in the midst of thee. How shall I give thee up,
Ephraim? How shall I surrender thee, O Israel? My
heart is turned within Me, My compassions are kindled
together!</i></p>

<p>Jehovah will seek, find and bring back the wanderer.
Yet the process shall not be easy. The gospel which
Hosea here preaches is matched in its great tenderness
by its full recognition of the ethical requirements
of the case. Israel may not be restored without
repentance, and cannot repent without disillusion and
chastisement. God will therefore show her that her
lovers, the Ba'alim, are unable to assure to her the gifts
for which she followed them. These are His corn, His
wine, His wool and His flax, and He will take them
away for a time. Nay more, as if mere drought and
blight might still be regarded as some Ba'al's work,
He who has always manifested Himself by great historic
deeds will do so again. He will remove herself from
the land, and leave it a waste and a desolation. The
whole passage runs as follows, introduced by the initial
<i>Therefore</i> of judgment:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Therefore, behold, I am going to hedge</i><a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> <i>up her</i><a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> <i>way
with thorns, and build her</i><a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> <i>a wall, so that she find not her
paths. And she shall pursue her paramours and shall
not come upon them, seek them and shall not find them;
and she shall say, Let me go and return to my first
husband, for it was better for me then than now. She
knew not, then, that it was I who gave her the corn and
the wine and the oil; yea, silver I heaped upon her and</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
<i>gold&mdash;they worked it up for the Ba'al!</i><a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Israel had
deserted the religion that was historical and moral for
the religion that was physical. But the historical
religion was the physical one. Jehovah who had
brought Israel to the land was also the God of the Land.
He would prove this by taking away its blessings.
<i>Therefore I will turn and take away My corn in its time
and My wine in its season, and I will withdraw My wool
and My flax that should have covered her nakedness.
And now</i>&mdash;the other initial of judgment&mdash;<i>I will lay bare
her shame to the eyes of her lovers, and no man shall
rescue her from My hand. And I will make an end of
all her joyaunce, her pilgrimages, her New-Moons and her
Sabbaths, with every festival; and I will destroy her vines
and her figs of which she said, "They are a gift, mine
own, which my lovers gave me," and I will turn them to
jungle and the wild beast shall devour them. So shall
I visit upon her the days of the Ba'alim, when she used to
offer incense to them, and decked herself with her rings
and her jewels and went after her paramours, but Me
she forgat&mdash;'tis the oracle of Jehovah.</i> All this implies
something more than such natural disasters as those in
which Amos saw the first chastisements of the Lord.
Each of the verses suggests, not only a devastation of
the land by war,<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> but the removal of the people into
captivity. Evidently, therefore, Hosea, writing about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
745, had in view a speedy invasion by Assyria, an
invasion which was always followed up by the exile
of the people subdued.</p>

<p>This is next described, with all plainness, under the
figure of Israel's early wanderings in the wilderness,
but is emphasised as happening only for the end of the
people's penitence and restoration. The new hope is
so melodious that it carries the language into metre.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Therefore, lo! I am to woo her, and I will bring her to the wilderness,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And I will speak home to her heart.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And from there I will give to her her vineyards,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And the Valley of Achor for a doorway of hope.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And there she shall answer</i> Me <i>as in the days of her youth,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And as the day when she came up from the land of Mi&#7779;raim.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To us the terms of this passage may seem formal
and theological. But to every Israelite some of these
terms must have brought back the days of his own
wooing. <i>I will speak home to her heart</i> is a forcible
expression, like the German "an das Herz" or the
sweet Scottish "it cam' up roond my heart," and was
used in Israel as from man to woman when he won
her.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> But the other terms have an equal charm.
The prophet, of course, does not mean that Israel
shall be literally taken back to the desert. But he
describes her coming Exile under that ancient figure,
in order to surround her penitence with the associations
of her innocency and her youth. By the grace of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
everything shall begin again as at first. The old terms
<i>wilderness</i>, <i>the giving of vineyards</i>, <i>Valley of Achor</i>, are,
as it were, the wedding ring restored.</p>

<p>As a result of all this (whether the words be by
Hosea or another),<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>It shall be in that day&mdash;'tis Jehovah's oracle&mdash;that thou shalt call Me, My husband,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And thou shalt not again call Me, My Ba'al:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For I will take away the names of the Ba'alim from her mouth,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And they shall no more be remembered by their names.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There follows a picture of the ideal future, in which&mdash;how
unlike the vision that now closes the Book of
Amos!&mdash;moral and spiritual beauty, the peace of the
land and the redemption of the people, are wonderfully
mingled together, in a style so characteristic of Hosea's
heart. It is hard to tell where the rhythmical prose
passes into actual metre.</p>

<p><i>And I will make for them a covenant in that day with
the wild beasts, and with the birds of the heavens, and
with the creeping things of the ground; and the bow and
the sword and battle will I break from the land, and I will
make you to dwell in safety. And I will betroth thee to
Me for ever, and I will betroth thee to Me in righteousness
and in justice, in leal love and in tender mercies; and I
will betroth thee to Me in faithfulness, and thou shalt know
Jehovah.</i></p>

<p><i>And it shall be on that day I will speak&mdash;'tis the oracle
of Jehovah&mdash;I will speak to the heavens, and they shall
speak to the earth; and the earth shall speak to the corn
and the wine and the oil, and they shall speak to Jezreel,
the scattered like seed</i> across many lands; <i>but I will sow</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
<i>him</i><a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> <i>for Myself in the land: and I will have a father's
pity upon Un-Pitied; and to Not-My-People</i> I will say.
<i>My people thou art! and he shall say, My God!</i><a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>The circle is thus completed on the terms from which
we started. The three names which Hosea gave to
the children, evil omens of Israel's fate, are reversed,
and the people restored to the favour and love of their
God.</p>

<p>We might expect this glory to form the culmination
of the prophecy. What fuller prospect could be
imagined than that we see in the close of the second
chapter? With a wonderful grace, however, the prophecy
turns back from this sure vision of the restoration
of the people as a whole, to pick up again the individual
from whom it had started, and whose unclean rag of
a life had fluttered out of sight before the national
fortunes sweeping in upon the scene. This was
needed to crown the story&mdash;this return to the
individual.</p>

<p><i>And Jehovah said unto me, Once more go, love a wife
that is loved of a paramour and is an adulteress,</i><a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> <i>as
Jehovah loveth the children of Israel, the while they are
turning to other gods, and love raisin-cakes</i>&mdash;probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
some element in the feasts of the gods of the land, the
givers of the grape. <i>Then I bought her to me for fifteen
pieces of silver and a homer of barley and a lethech of
wine.</i><a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> <i>And I said to her, For many days shall thou
abide for me alone; thou shall not play the harlot, thou
shall not be for any husband; and I for my part also
shall be so towards thee. For the days are many that
the children of Israel shall abide without a king and
without a prince, without sacrifice and without maççebah,
and without ephod and teraphim.</i><a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> <i>Afterwards the children
of Israel shall turn and seek Jehovah their God and
David their king, and shall be in awe of Jehovah and
towards His goodness in the end of the days.</i><a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>Do not let us miss the fact that the story of the
wife's restoration follows that of Israel's, although the
story of the wife's unfaithfulness had come before that
of Israel's apostasy. For this order means that, while
the prophet's private pain preceded his sympathy with
God's pain, it was not he who set God, but God who
set him, the example of forgiveness. The man learned
the God's sorrow out of his own sorrow; but conversely
he was taught to forgive and redeem his wife only by
seeing God forgive and redeem the people. In other
words, the Divine was suggested by the human pain;
yet the Divine Grace was not started by any previous
human grace, but, on the contrary, was itself the precedent
and origin of the latter. This is in harmony
with all Hosea's teaching. God forgives because <i>He is
God and not man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> Our pain with those we love helps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
us to understand God's pain; but it is not our love
that leads us to believe in His love. On the contrary,
all human grace is but the reflex of the Divine. So
St. Paul: <i>Even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye</i>.
So St. John: <i>We love Him</i>, and one another, <i>because
He first loved us</i>.</p>

<p>But this return from the nation to the individual has
another interest. Gomer's redemption is not the mere
formal completion of the parallel between her and her
people. It is, as the story says, an impulse of the
Divine Love, recognised even then in Israel as seeking
the individual. He who followed Hagar into the
wilderness, who met Jacob at Bethel and forgat not
the slave Joseph in prison,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> remembers also Hosea's
wife. His love is not satisfied with His Nation-Bride:
He remembers this single outcast. It is the Shepherd
leaving the ninety-and-nine in the fold to seek the one
lost sheep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For Hosea himself his home could never be the same
as it was at the first. <i>And I said to her, For many days
shalt thou abide, as far as I am concerned, alone. Thou
shalt not play the harlot. Thou shalt not be for a
husband: and I on my side also shall be so towards thee.</i>
Discipline was needed there; and abroad the nation's
troubles called the prophet to an anguish and a toil
which left no room for the sweet love or hope of his
youth. He steps at once to his hard warfare for
his people; and through the rest of his book we never
again hear him speak of home, or of children, or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
wife. So Arthur passed from Guinevere to his last
battle for his land:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE THICK NIGHT OF ISRAEL</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> iv.-xiv.</h5>


<p>It was indeed "thick night" into which this Arthur
of Israel stepped from his shattered home. The
mists drive across Hosea's long agony with his people,
and what we see, we see blurred and broken. There
is stumbling and clashing; crowds in drift; confused
rallies; gangs of assassins breaking across the highways;
doors opening upon lurid interiors full of
drunken riot. Voices, which other voices mock, cry
for a dawn that never comes. God Himself is Laughter,
Lightning, a Lion, a Gnawing Worm. Only one clear
note breaks over the confusion&mdash;the trumpet summoning
to war.</p>

<p>Take courage, O great heart! Not thus shall it
always be! There wait thee, before the end, of open
Visions at least two&mdash;one of Memory and one of Hope,
one of Childhood and one of Spring. Past this night,
past the swamp and jungle of these fetid years, thou
shalt see thy land in her beauty, and God shall look
on the face of His Bride.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Chaps, iv.-xiv. are almost indivisible. The two
Visions just mentioned, chaps. xi. and xiv. 3-9, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
be detached by virtue of contributing the only strains
of gospel which rise victorious above the Lord's controversy
with His people and the troubled story of
their sins. All the rest is the noise of a nation falling
to pieces, the crumbling of a splendid past. And as
decay has no climax and ruin no rhythm, so we may
understand why it is impossible to divide with any
certainty Hosea's record of Israel's fall. Some arrangement
we must attempt, but it is more or less artificial,
and to be undertaken for the sake of our own minds,
that cannot grasp so great a collapse all at once.
Chap. iv. has a certain unity, and is followed by a
new exordium, but as it forms only the theme of which
the subsequent chapters are variations, we may take
it with them as far as chap. vii., ver. 7; after which
there is a slight transition from the moral signs of
Israel's dissolution to the political&mdash;although Hosea
still combines the religious offence of idolatry with
the anarchy of the land. These form the chief interest
to the end of chap. x. Then breaks the bright Vision
of the Past, chap. xi., the temporary victory of the
Gospel of the Prophet over his Curse. In chaps. xii.-xiv.
2 we are plunged into the latter once more, and
reach in xiv. 3 ff. the second bright Vision, the Vision of
the Future. To each of these phases of Israel's Thick
Night&mdash;we can hardly call them Sections&mdash;we may
devote a chapter of simple exposition, adding three
chapters more of detailed examination of the main
doctrines we shall have encountered on our way&mdash;the
Knowledge of God, Repentance, and the Sin against
Love.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<h3><i>A PEOPLE IN DECAY: 1. MORALLY</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> iv.-vii 7.</h5>


<p>Pursuing the plan laid down in the last chapter,
we now take the section of Hosea's discourse
which lies between chap. iv. 1 and chap. vii. 7.
Chap. iv. is the only really separable bit of it; but
there are also slight breaks at v. 15 and vii. 2. So we
may attempt a division into four periods: 1. Chap. iv.,
which states God's general charge against the people;
2. Chap. v. 1-14, which discusses the priests and
princes; 3. Chaps. v. 15-vii. 2, which abjures the
people's attempts at repentance; and 4. Chap. vii. 3-7,
which is a lurid spectacle of the drunken and profligate
court. All these give symptoms of the moral
decay of the people,&mdash;the family destroyed by impurity,
and society by theft and murder; the corruption of the
spiritual guides of the people; the debauchery of the
nobles; the sympathy of the throne with evil,&mdash;with
the despairing judgment that such a people are incapable
even of repentance. The keynotes are these:
<i>No troth, leal love, nor knowledge of God in the land.
Priest and Prophet stumble. Ephraim and Judah
stumble. I am as the moth to Ephraim. What can
I make of thee, Ephraim? When I would heal them,
their guilt is only the more exposed.</i> Morally, Israel is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
rotten. The prophet, of course, cannot help adding
signs of their political incoherence. But these he deals
with more especially in the part of his discourse which
follows chap. vii. 7.</p>


<h4>1. <span class="smcap"><a id="The_Lords_Quarrel_with_Israel"></a>The Lord's Quarrel with Israel.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> iv.</h5>

<p><i>Hear the word of Jehovah, sons of Israel!</i><a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> <i>Jehovah
hath a quarrel with the inhabitants of the land, for there
is no troth nor leal love nor knowledge of God in the
land. Perjury</i><a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> <i>and murder and theft and adultery!</i><a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
<i>They break out, and blood strikes upon blood.</i></p>

<p>That stable and well-furnished life, across which,
while it was still noon, Amos hurled his alarms&mdash;how
quickly it has broken up! If there be still <i>ease in Zion</i>,
there is no more <i>security in Samaria</i>.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> The great
Jeroboam is dead, and society, which in the East depends
so much on the individual, is loose and falling
to pieces. The sins which are exposed by Amos were
those that lurked beneath a still strong government,
but Hosea adds outbreaks which set all order at
defiance. Later we shall find him describing housebreaking,
highway robbery and assassination. <i>Therefore
doth the land wither, and every one of her denizens
languisheth, even to the beast of the field and the fowl of
the heaven; yea, even the fish of the sea are swept up</i>
in the universal sickness of man and nature: for Hosea
feels, like Amos, the liability of nature to the curse
upon sin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the guilt is not that of the whole people, but
of their religious guides. <i>Let none find fault and none
upbraid, for My people are but as their priestlings.</i><a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> <i>O
Priest, thou hast stumbled to-day: and stumble to-night
shall the prophet with thee.</i> One order of the nation's
ministers goes staggering after the other! <i>And I
will destroy thy Mother</i>, presumably the Nation herself.
<i>Perished are My people for lack of knowledge.</i> But how?
By the sin of their teachers. <i>Because thou</i>, O Priest,
<i>hast rejected knowledge, I reject thee from being priest to
Me; and as thou hast forgotten the Torah of thy God, I
forget thy children</i><a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>&mdash;<i>I on My side. As many as they be,
so many have sinned against Me.</i> Every jack-priest of
them is culpable. <i>They have turned</i><a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> <i>their glory into
shame. They feed on the sin of My people, and to the
guilt of these lift up their appetite!</i> The more the
people sin, the more merrily thrive the priests by fines
and sin-offerings. They live upon the vice of the day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and have a vested interest in its crimes. English
Langland said the same thing of the friars of his time.
The contention is obvious. The priests have given
themselves wholly to the ritual; they have forgotten
that their office is an intellectual and moral one.
We shall return to this when treating of Hosea's
doctrine of knowledge and its responsibilities. Priesthood,
let us only remember, priesthood is an intellectual
trust.</p>

<p><i>Thus it comes to be&mdash;like people like priest</i>: they also
have fallen under the ritual, doing from lust what the
priests do from greed. <i>But I will visit upon them
their ways, and their deeds will I requite to them.
For they</i>&mdash;those <i>shall eat and not be satisfied</i>, these
<i>shall play the harlot and have no increase, because they
have left off heeding Jehovah</i>. This absorption in ritual
at the expense of the moral and intellectual elements
of religion has insensibly led them over into idolatry,
with all its unchaste and drunken services. <i>Harlotry,
wine and new wine take away the brains!</i><a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> The result
is seen in the stupidity with which they consult their
stocks for guidance. <i>My people! of its bit of wood
it asketh counsel, and its staff telleth to it</i> the oracle!
<i>For a spirit of harlotry hath led them astray, and they
have played the harlot from their God. Upon the headlands
of the hills they sacrifice, and on the heights offer
incense, under oak or poplar or terebinth, for the shade of
them is pleasant.</i> On <i>headlands</i>, not summits, for here
no trees grow; and the altar was generally built under
a tree and near water on some promontory, from which
the flight of birds or of clouds might be watched.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
<i>Wherefore</i>&mdash;because of this your frequenting of the
heathen shrines&mdash;<i>your daughters play the harlot and
your daughters-in-law commit adultery. I will not come
with punishment upon your daughters because they play
the harlot, nor upon your daughters-in-law because they
commit adultery.</i> Why? For <i>they themselves</i>, the
fathers of Israel&mdash;or does he still mean the priests?&mdash;<i>go
aside with the harlots and sacrifice with the common
women of the shrines</i>! It is vain for the men of a
nation to practise impurity, and fancy that nevertheless
they can keep their womankind chaste. <i>So the stupid
people fall to ruin!</i></p>

<p>(<i>Though thou play the harlot, Israel, let not Judah
bring guilt on herself. And come not to Gilgal, and go
not up to Beth-Aven, and take not your oath</i> at the Well-of-the-Oath,
Beer-Sheba,<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> <i>By the life of Jehovah!</i> This
obvious parenthesis may be either by Hosea or a later
writer; the latter is more probable.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>)</p>

<p><i>Yea, like a wild heifer Israel has gone wild. How
now can Jehovah feed them like a lamb in a broad
meadow?</i> To treat this clause interrogatively is the
only way to get sense out of it.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> <i>Wedded to idols is
Ephraim: leave him alone.</i> The participle means
<i>mated</i> or <i>leagued</i>. The corresponding noun is used of
a wife as the <i>mate</i> of her husband<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> and of an idolater
as the <i>mate</i> of his idols.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> The expression is doubly
appropriate here, since Hosea used marriage as the
figure of the relation of a deity to his worshippers.
<i>Leave him alone</i>&mdash;he must go from bad to worse. <i>Their
drunkenness over, they take to harlotry: her rulers have</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
<i>fallen in love with shame, or they love shame more than
their pride.</i><a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> But in spite of all their servile worship
the Assyrian tempest shall sweep them away in its
trail. <i>A wind hath wrapt them up in her skirts; and
they shall be put to shame by their sacrifices.</i></p>

<p>This brings the passage to such a climax as Amos
loved to crown his periods. And the opening of the
next chapter offers a new exordium.</p>


<h4>2. <span class="smcap"><a id="Priests_and_Princes_Fail"></a>Priests and Princes Fail.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> v. 1-14.</h5>

<p>The line followed in this paragraph is almost parallel
to that of chap. iv., running out to a prospect of invasion.
But the charge is directed solely against the chiefs of
the people, and the strictures of chap. vii. 7 ff. upon
the political folly of the rulers are anticipated.</p>

<p><i>Hear this, O Priests, and hearken, House of Israel, and,
House of the King, give ear. For on you is the sentence!</i>
You, who have hitherto been the judges, this time
shall be judged.</p>

<p><i>A snare have ye become at Mizpeh, and a net spread
out upon Tabor, and a pit have they made deep upon
Shittim;</i><a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> <i>but I shall be the scourge of them all. I know
Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from Me&mdash;for now hast
thou played the harlot, Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</i> The
worship on the high places, whether nominally of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Jehovah or not, was sheer service of Ba'alim. It was
in the interest both of the priesthood and of the rulers
to multiply these sanctuaries, but they were only traps
for the people. <i>Their deeds will not let them return
to their God; for a harlot spirit is in their midst,
and Jehovah</i>, for all their oaths by Him, <i>they have
not known. But the pride of Israel shall testify to his
face; and Israel and Ephraim shall stumble by their guilt&mdash;stumble
also shall Judah with them.</i> By Israel's pride
many understand God. But the term is used too opprobriously
by Amos to allow us to agree to this. The
phrase must mean that Israel's arrogance, or her proud
prosperity, by the wounds which it feels in this time of
national decay, shall itself testify against the people&mdash;a
profound ethical symptom to which we shall return
when treating of Repentance.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Yet the verse may be
rendered in harmony with the context: <i>the pride of
Israel shall be humbled to his face. With their sheep
and their cattle they go about to seek Jehovah, and shall
not find</i> Him; <i>He hath drawn off from them. They
have been unfaithful to Jehovah, for they have begotten</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
<i>strange children</i>. A generation has grown up who are
not His. <i>Now may a month devour them with their
portions!</i> Any month may bring the swift invader.
Hark! the alarum of war! How it reaches to the back
of the land!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Blow the trumpet in Gibeah, the clarion in Ramah;</i><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><i>Ephraim shall become desolation in the day of rebuke!
Among the tribes of Israel I have made known what is certain!</i></p>

<p>At this point, ver. 10, the discourse swerves from the
religious to the political leaders of Israel; but as the
princes were included with the priests in the exordium
(ver. 1), we can hardly count this a new oracle.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p><i>The princes of Judah are like landmark-removers</i>&mdash;commonest
of cheats in Israel&mdash;<i>upon them will I pour
out My wrath like water. Ephraim is oppressed, crushed
is</i> his <i>right, for he wilfully went after vanity.</i><a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> <i>And I am

<i>Judah.</i> Both kingdoms have begun to fall to pieces,
for by this time Uzziah of Judah also is dead, and the
weak politicians are in charge whom Isaiah satirised.
<i>And Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his sore; and
Ephraim went to Asshur and</i><a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> <i>sent to King Jareb&mdash;King
Combative, King Pick-Quarrel</i>,<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> a nickname for the
Assyrian monarch. The verse probably refers to the
tribute which Menahem sent to Assyria in 738. If so,
then Israel has drifted full five years into her "thick
night." <i>But He cannot heal you, nor dry up your sore.
For I</i>, Myself, <i>am like a lion to Ephraim, and like a
young lion to the house of Judah. I, I rend and go My
way; I carry off and there is none to deliver.</i> It is the
same truth which Isaiah expressed with even greater
grimness.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> God Himself is His people's sore; and
not all their statecraft nor alliances may heal what He
inflicts. Priests and Princes, then, have alike failed.
A greater failure is to follow.</p>


<h4>3. <span class="smcap"><a id="Repentance_Fails"></a>Repentance Fails.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> v. 15-vii. 2.</h5>

<p>Seeing that their leaders are so helpless, and feeling
their wounds, the people may themselves turn to God
for healing, but that will be with a repentance so shallow
as also to be futile. They have no conviction of sin,
nor appreciation of how deeply their evils have eaten.</p>

<p>This too facile repentance is expressed in a prayer
which the Christian Church has paraphrased into one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
of its most beautiful hymns of conversion. Yet the
introduction to this prayer, and its own easy assurance
of how soon God will heal the wounds He has made,
as well as the impatience with which God receives it,
oblige us to take the prayer in another sense than the
hymn which has been derived from it.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> It offers but
one more symptom of the optimism of this light-hearted
people, whom no discipline and no judgment
can impress with the reality of their incurable decay.
They said of themselves, <i>The bricks are fallen, let us
build with stones</i>,<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> and now they say just as easily and
airily of their God, <i>He hath torn</i> only <i>that He may heal</i>:
we are fallen, but <i>He will raise us up again in a day or
two</i>. At first it is still God who speaks.</p>

<p><i>I am going My way, I am returning to My own place,</i><a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>

With incredulity, with impatience. <i>What can I make

so early gone.</i> Their shallow hearts need deepening.
Have they not been deepened enough? <i>Wherefore
I have hewn</i> them <i>by the prophets, I have slain them by
the words of My mouth, and My judgment goeth forth like
the lightning.</i><a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> <i>For leal love have I desired, and not
sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.</i></p>

<p>That the discourse comes back to the ritual is very
intelligible. For what could make repentance seem so
easy as the belief that forgiveness can be won by
simply offering sacrifices? Then the prophet leaps
upon what each new year of that anarchy revealed
afresh&mdash;the profound sinfulness of the people.</p>

<p><i>But they in human fashion</i><a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> <i>have transgressed the
covenant! There</i>&mdash;he will now point out the very
spots&mdash;<i>have they betrayed</i><a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> <i>Me! Gilead is a city of evildoers:</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
<i>stamped with bloody footprints; assassins</i><a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> <i>in
troops; a gang of priests murder on the way to Shechem.
Yea, crime</i><a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> <i>have they done. In the house of Israel I have
seen horrors: there Ephraim hath played the harlot:
Israel is defiled&mdash;Judah as well.</i><a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>Truly the sinfulness of Israel is endless. Every
effort to redeem them only discovers more of it. <i>When
I would turn, when I would heal Israel, then the guilt of
Ephraim displays itself and the evils of Samaria</i>, these
namely: <i>that they work fraud, and the thief cometh in</i>&mdash;evidently
a technical term for housebreaking<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>&mdash;while
<i>abroad a crew</i> of highwaymen <i>foray. And they never
think in their hearts that all their evil is recorded by Me.
Now have their deeds encompassed them: they are constantly
before Me.</i></p>

<p>Evidently real repentance on the part of such a
people is impossible. As Hosea said before, <i>Their
deeds will not let them return.</i><a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>


<h4>4. <span class="smcap"><a id="Wickedness_in_High_Places"></a>Wickedness in High Places.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> vii. 3-7.</h5>

<p>There follows now a very difficult passage. The
text is corrupt, and we have no means of determining
what precise events are intended. The drift of meaning,
however, is evident. The disorder and licentiousness
of the people are favoured in high places; the throne
itself is guilty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p><i>With their evil they make a king glad, and princes
with their falsehoods: all of them are adulterers, like an
oven heated by the baker,...</i><a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p><i>On the day of our king</i>&mdash;some coronation or king's
birthday&mdash;<i>the princes were sick with fever from wine.
He stretched forth his hand with loose fellows</i>,<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> presumably
made them his associates. <i>Like an oven have
they made</i><a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> <i>their hearts with their intriguing.</i><a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> <i>All night
their anger sleepeth:</i><a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> <i>in the morning it blazes like a
flame of fire. All of them glow like an oven, and devour
their rulers: all their kings have fallen, without one of
them calling on Me.</i></p>

<p>An obscure passage upon obscure events; yet so
lurid with the passion of that fevered people in the
flagrant years 743-735 that we can make out the
kind of crimes described. A king surrounded by
loose and unscrupulous nobles: adultery, drunkenness,
conspiracies, assassinations: every man striking for
himself; none appealing to God.</p>

<p>From the court, then, downwards, by princes,
priests and prophets, to the common fathers of Israel
and their households, immorality prevails. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
no redeeming feature, and no hope of better things.
For repentance itself the capacity is gone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In making so thorough an indictment of the moral
condition of Israel, it would have been impossible for
Hosea not to speak also of the political stupidity and
restlessness which resulted from it. But he has largely
reserved these for that part of his discourse which now
follows, and which we will take in the next chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<h3><i>A PEOPLE IN DECAY: II. POLITICALLY</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> vii. 8-x.</h5>


<p>Moral decay means political decay. Sins like
these are the gangrene of nations. It is part
of Hosea's greatness to have traced this, a proof of that
versatility which distinguishes him above other prophets.
The most spiritual of them all, he is at the same time
the most political. We owe him an analysis of repentance
to which the New Testament has little to add;<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>
but he has also left us a criticism of society and of
politics in Israel, unrivalled except by Isaiah. We
owe him an intellectual conception of God,<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> which for
the first time in Israel exploded idolatry; yet he also
is the first to define Israel's position in the politics of
Western Asia. With the simple courage of conscience
Amos had said to the people: You are bad, therefore
you must perish. But Hosea's is the insight to follow
the processes by which sin brings forth death&mdash;to
trace, for instance, the effects of impurity upon a
nation's powers of reproduction, as well as upon its
intellectual vigour.</p>

<p>So intimate are these two faculties of Hosea, that in
chapters devoted chiefly to the sins of Israel we have
already seen him expose the political disasters that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
follow. But from the point we have now reached&mdash;chap.
vii. 8&mdash;the proportion of his prophesying is
reversed: he gives us less of the sin and more of the
social decay and political folly of his age.</p>


<h4>I. <span class="smcap"><a id="The_Confusion_of_the_Nation"></a>The Confusion of the Nation.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> vii. 8-viii. 3.</h5>

<p>Hosea begins by summing up the public aspect of
Israel in two epigrams, short but of marvellous adequacy
(vii. 8):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ephraim&mdash;among the nations he mixeth himself:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ephraim has become a cake not turned.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is a great crisis for any nation to pass from the
seclusion of its youth and become a factor in the main
history of the world. But for Israel the crisis was trebly
great. Their difference from all other tribes about
them had struck the Canaanites on their first entry to
the land:<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> their own earliest writers had emphasised
their seclusion as their strength;<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> and their first
prophets consistently deprecated every overture made
by them either to Egypt or to Assyria. We feel the
force of the prophets' policy when we remember what
happened to the Philistines. These were a people as
strong and as distinctive as Israel, with whom at one
time they disputed possession of the whole land. But
their position as traders in the main line of traffic
between Asia and Africa rendered the Philistines
peculiarly open to foreign influence. They were now
Egyptian vassals, now Assyrian victims; and after the
invasion of Alexander the Great their cities became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
centres of Hellenism, while the Jews upon their secluded
hills still stubbornly held unmixed their race and their
religion. This contrast, so remarkably developed in
later centuries, has justified the prophets of the eighth
in their anxiety that Israel should not annul the advantages
of her geographical seclusion by trade or treaties
with the Gentiles. But it was easier for Judæa to
take heed to the warning than for Ephraim. The
latter lies as open and fertile as her sister-province is
barren and aloof. She has many gates into the world,
and they open upon many markets. Nobler opportunities
there could not be for a nation in the maturity
of its genius and loyal to its vocation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Rejoice, O Zebulun, in thine outgoings:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>They shall call the nations to the mountain;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>They shall suck of the abundance of the seas,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And of the treasure that is stored in the sands.</i><a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But in the time of his outgoings Ephraim was not sure
of himself nor true to his God, the one secret and
strength of the national distinctiveness. So he met
the world weak and unformed, and, instead of impressing
it, was by it dissipated and confused. The tides
of a lavish commerce scattered abroad the faculties of
the people, and swept back upon their life alien fashions
and tempers, to subdue which there was neither native
strength nor definiteness of national purpose. All this
is what Hosea means by the first of his epigrams:
<i>Ephraim&mdash;among the nations he lets himself be poured
out</i>, or <i>mixed up</i>. The form of the verb does not elsewhere
occur; but it is reflexive, and the meaning of
the root is certain. <i>Balal</i> is to <i>pour out</i>, or <i>mingle</i>, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
of oil in the sacrificial flour. Yet it is sometimes used
of a mixing which is not sacred, but profane and hopeless.
It is applied to the first great confusion of
mankind, to which a popular etymology has traced the
name Babel, as if for Balbel. Derivatives of the stem
bear the additional ideas of staining and impurity.
The alternative renderings which have been proposed,
<i>lets himself be soaked</i> and <i>scatters himself</i> abroad like
wheat among tares, are not so probable, yet hardly
change the meaning.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Ephraim wastes and confuses
himself among the Gentiles. The nation's character
is so disguised that Hosea afterwards nicknames him
Canaan;<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> their religion so filled with foreign influences
that he calls the people the harlot of the Ba'alim.</p>

<p>If the first of Hosea's epigrams satirises Israel's
foreign relations, the second, with equal brevity and
wit, hits off the temper and constitution of society at
home. For the metaphor of which this epigram is
composed Hosea has gone to the baker. Among all
classes in the East, especially under conditions requiring
haste, there is in demand a round flat scone, which is
baked by being laid on hot stones or attached to the
wall of a heated oven. The whole art of baking
consists in turning the scone over at the proper
moment. If this be mismanaged, it does not need a
baker to tell us that one side may be burnt to a cinder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
while the other remains raw. <i>Ephraim</i>, says Hosea,
<i>is an unturned cake.</i></p>

<p>By this he may mean one of several things, or all
of them together, for they are infectious of each other.
There was, for instance, the social condition of the
people. What can better be described as an unturned
scone than a community one half of whose number
are too rich, and the other too poor? Or Hosea may
refer to that unequal distribution of religion through
life with which in other parts of his prophecy he
reproaches Israel. They keep their religion, as Amos
more fully tells us, for their temples, and neglect to
carry its spirit into their daily business. Or he may
refer to Israel's politics, which were equally in want
of thoroughness. They rushed hotly at an enterprise,
but having expended so much fire in the beginning
of it, they let the end drop cold and dead. Or he may
wish to satirise, like Amos, Israel's imperfect culture&mdash;the
pretentious and overdone arts, stuck excrescence-wise
upon the unrefined bulk of the nation, just as in
many German principalities last century society took on
a few French fashions in rough and exaggerated forms,
while at heart still brutal and coarse. Hosea may
mean any one of these things, for the figure suits all,
and all spring from the same defect. Want of
thoroughness and equable effort was Israel's besetting
sin, and it told on all sides of his life. How better
describe a half-fed people, a half-cultured society, a
half-lived religion, a half-hearted policy, than by a
half-baked scone?</p>

<p>We who are so proud of our political bakers, we
who scorn the rapid revolutions of our neighbours and
complacently dwell upon our equable ovens, those slow
and cautious centuries of political development which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
lie behind us&mdash;have we anything better than our
neighbours, anything better than Israel, to show in
our civilisation? Hosea's epigram fits us to the letter.
After all those ages of baking, society is still with us
<i>an unturned scone</i>: one end of the nation with the
strength burnt out of it by too much enjoyment of life,
the other with not enough of warmth to be quickened
into anything like adequate vitality. No man can deny
that this is so; we are able to live only by shutting
our hearts to the fact. Or is religion equably distributed
through the lives of the religious portion of
our nation? Of late years religion has spread, and
spread wonderfully, but of how many Christians is it
still true that they are but half-baked&mdash;living a life one
side of which is reeking with the smoke of sacrifice,
while the other is never warmed by one religious
thought. We may have too much religion if we
confine it to one day or one department of life: our
worship overdone, with the sap and the freshness
burnt out of it, cindery, dusty, unattractive, fit only
for crumbling; our conduct cold, damp and heavy,
like dough the fire has never reached.</p>

<p>Upon the theme of these two epigrams the other
verses of this chapter are variations. Has Ephraim
mixed himself among the peoples? <i>Strangers have
devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not</i>, senselessly
congratulating himself upon the increase of his trade
and wealth, while he does not feel that these have
sucked from him all his distinctive virtue. <i>Yea, grey
hairs are sprinkled upon him, and he knoweth it not.</i> He
makes his energy the measure of his life, as Isaiah
also marked,<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> but sees not that it all means waste and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
decay. <i>The pride of Israel testifieth to his face, yet</i>&mdash;even
when the pride of the nation is touched to the
quick by such humiliating overtures as they make to
both Assyria and Egypt<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>&mdash;<i>they do not return to Jehovah
their God, nor seek Him for all this</i>.</p>

<p>With virtue and single-hearted faith have disappeared
intellect and the capacity for affairs. <i>Ephraim is
become like a silly dove&mdash;a dove without heart</i>, to the
Hebrews the organ of the wits of a man&mdash;<i>they cry to
Egypt, they go off to Assyria</i>. Poor pigeon of a people,
fluttering from one refuge to another! But <i>as they go
I will throw over them My net, like a bird of the air I
will bring them down. I will punish them as their
congregation have heard</i>&mdash;this text as it stands<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> can
only mean "in the manner I have publicly proclaimed
in Israel." <i>Woe to them that they have strayed from Me!
Damnation to them that they have rebelled against Me!
While I would have redeemed them, they spoke lies about
Me. And they have never cried unto Me with their heart,
but they keep howling on their beds for corn and new wine.</i>
No real repentance theirs, but some fear of drought
and miscarriage of the harvests, a sensual and servile
sorrow in which they wallow. They seek God with
no heart, no true appreciation of what He is, but use
the senseless means by which the heathen invoke their
gods: <i>they cut themselves,</i><a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> <i>and</i> so <i>apostatise from Me!
And yet it was I who disciplined them, I strengthened their
arm, but with regard to Me they kept thinking</i> only <i>evil!</i>
So fickle and sensitive to fear, <i>they turn</i> indeed, <i>but not
upwards</i>; no Godward conversion theirs. In their
repentance <i>they are like a bow which swerves</i>&mdash;off upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
some impulse of their ill-balanced natures. <i>Their
princes must fall by the sword because of the bitterness</i>&mdash;we
should have expected "falseness"&mdash;<i>of their tongue:
this is their scorn in the land of Egypt!</i> To the allusion
we have no key.</p>

<p>With so false a people nothing can be done. Their
doom is inevitable. So</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>To thy mouth with the trumpet! The Eagle is down
upon the house of Jehovah!</i><a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Where the carcase is, there
are the eagles gathered together. <i>For</i>&mdash;to sum up the
whole crisis&mdash;<i>they have transgressed My covenant, and
against My law have they rebelled. To Me they cry,
My God, we know Thee, we Israel!</i> What does it
matter? <i>Israel hath spurned the good:</i><a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> <i>the Foe must
pursue him.</i></p>

<p>It is the same climax of inevitable war to which
Amos led up his periods; and a new subject is now
introduced.</p>


<h4>2. <span class="smcap"><a id="Artificial_Kings_and_Artificial_Gods"></a>Artificial Kings and Artificial Gods.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> viii. 4-13.</h5>

<p>The curse of such a state of dissipation as that to
which Israel had fallen is that it produces no men.
Had the people had in them "the root of the matter,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
had there been the stalk and the fibre of a national
consciousness and purpose, it would have blossomed to
a man. In the similar time of her outgoings upon the
world Prussia had her Frederick the Great, and Israel,
too, would have produced a leader, a heaven-sent king,
if the national spirit had not been squandered on
foreign trade and fashions. But after the death of
Jeroboam every man who rose to eminence in Israel,
rose, not on the nation, but only on the fevered and
transient impulse of some faction; and through the
broken years one party monarch was lifted after
another to the brief tenancy of a blood-stained throne.
They were not from God, these monarchs; but man-made,
and sooner or later man-murdered. With his
sharp insight Hosea likens these artificial kings to the
artificial gods, also the work of men's hands; and till
near the close of his book the idols of the sanctuary
and the puppets of the throne form the twin targets of
his scorn.</p>

<p><i>They have made kings, but not from Me; they have
made princes, but I knew not. With their silver and
their gold they have manufactured themselves idols, only
that they</i><a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> <i>may be cut off</i>&mdash;king after king, idol upon idol.
<i>He loathes thy Calf, O Samaria</i>, the thing of wood and
gold which thou callest Jehovah. And God confirms
this. <i>Kindled is Mine anger against them! How long
will they be incapable of innocence?</i>&mdash;unable to clear
themselves of guilt! The idol is still in his mind.
<i>For from Israel is it also</i>&mdash;as much as the puppet-kings;
<i>a workman made it, and no god is it. Yea,
splinters shall the Calf of Samaria become.</i><a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> Splinters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
shall everything in Israel become. <i>For they sow the
wind, and the whirlwind shall they reap.</i> Indeed like a
storm Hosea's own language now sweeps along; and
his metaphors are torn into shreds upon it. <i>Stalk
it hath none: the sprout brings forth no grain: if it
were to bring forth, strangers would swallow it.</i><a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> Nay,
<i>Israel hath let herself be swallowed up! Already are
they become among the nations like a vessel there is no
more use for.</i> Heathen empires have sucked them dry.
<i>They have gone up to Assyria like a runaway wild-ass.
Ephraim hath hired lovers.</i><a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> It is again the note of their
mad dissipation among the foreigners. <i>But if they</i> thus
<i>give themselves away among the nations, I must gather
them in, and</i> then <i>shall they have to cease a little from
the anointing of a king and princes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> This wilful roaming
of theirs among the foreigners shall be followed by
compulsory exile, and all their unholy artificial politics
shall cease. The discourse turns to the other target.
<i>For Ephraim hath multiplied altars&mdash;to sin; altars are
his own&mdash;to sin. Were I to write for him by myriads
My laws,</i><a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> <i>as those of a stranger would they be accounted.

<i>guilt and make visitation upon their sin. They&mdash;to Egypt&mdash;shall
return</i>....<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Back to their ancient servitude

them to the wilderness.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>


<h4>3. <span class="smcap"><a id="The_Effects_of_Exile"></a>The Effects of Exile.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> ix. 1-9.</h5>

<p>Hosea now turns to describe the effects of exile
upon the social and religious habits of the people. It
must break up at once the joy and the sacredness of
their lives. Every pleasure will be removed, every taste
offended. Indeed, even now, with their conscience of
having deserted Jehovah, they cannot pretend to enjoy
the feasts of the Ba'alim in the same hearty way as the
heathen with whom they mix. But, whether or no, the
time is near when nature-feasts and all other religious
ceremonies&mdash;all that makes life glad and regular and
solemn&mdash;shall be impossible.</p>

<p><i>Rejoice not, O Israel, to</i> the pitch of <i>rapture like the
heathen, for thou hast played the harlot from thy God;
a harlot's hire hast thou loved on all threshing-floors.</i><a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>
<i>Threshing-floor and wine-vat shall ignore</i><a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> <i>them, and the
new wine shall play them false. They shall not abide in

off His own land. They will have to live like
animals, divorced from religion, unable to hold communion
with their God. <i>What shall ye do for days</i><a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> <i>of

invasion of their land, only <i>that Egypt may gather them
in, Memphis give them sepulture, nettles inherit their jewels
of silver, thorns</i> come up <i>in their tents</i>. The threat of
exile still wavers between Assyria and Egypt. And in
Egypt Memphis is chosen as the destined grave of
Israel; for even then her Pyramids and mausoleums
were ancient and renowned, her vaults and sepulchres
were countless and spacious.</p>

<p>But what need is there to seek the future for Israel's
doom, when already this is being fulfilled by the corruption
of her spiritual leaders?</p>

<p><i>The days of visitation have come, have come the days
of requital. Israel already experiences</i><a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> <i>them! A fool
is the prophet, raving mad the man of the spirit.</i> The
old ecstasy of Saul's day has become delirium and
fanaticism.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Why? <i>For the mass of thy guilt and the
multiplied treachery! Ephraim acts the spy with my God.</i>
There is probably a play on the name, for with the
meaning a <i>watchman</i> for God it is elsewhere used as
an honourable title of the prophets. <i>The prophet is a
fowler's snare upon all his ways. Treachery&mdash;they have</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
<i>made it profound in the very house of their God.</i><a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> <i>They
have done corruptly, as in the days of Gibeah. Their
iniquity is remembered; visitation is made on their sin.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These then were the symptoms of the profound
political decay which followed on Israel's immorality.
The national spirit and unity of the people had disappeared.
Society&mdash;half of it was raw, half of it was
baked to a cinder. The nation, broken into factions,
produced no man to lead, no king with the stamp of God
upon him. Anarchy prevailed; monarchs were made
and murdered. There was no prestige abroad, nothing but
contempt among the Gentiles for a people whom they
had exhausted. Judgment was inevitable by exile&mdash;nay,
it had come already in the corruption of the spiritual
leaders of the nation.</p>

<p>Hosea now turns to probe a deeper corruption still.</p>


<h4>4. "<span class="smcap"><a id="The_Corruption_that_is_through_Lust"></a>The Corruption that is through Lust.</span>"</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> ix. 10-17: cf. iv. 11-14.</h5>

<p>Those who at the present time are enforcing among
us the revival of a Paganism&mdash;without the Pagan conscience&mdash;and
exalting licentiousness to the level of an
art, forget how frequently the human race has attempted
their experiment, with far more sincerity than they
themselves can put into it, and how invariably the result
has been recorded by history to be weariness, decay and
death. On this occasion we have the story told to us
by one who to the experience of the statesman adds the
vision of the poet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>
<p>The generation to which Hosea belonged practised
a periodical unchastity under the alleged sanctions of
nature and religion. And, although their prophet told
them that&mdash;like our own apostates from Christianity&mdash;they
could never do so with the abandon of the Pagans,
for they carried within them the conscience and the
memory of a higher faith, it appears that even the
fathers of Israel resorted openly and without shame
to the licentious rites of the sanctuaries. In an earlier
passage of his book Hosea insists that all this must
impair the people's intellect. <i>Harlotry takes away the
brains.</i><a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> He has shown also how it confuses the
family, and has exposed the old delusion that men
may be impure and keep their womankind chaste.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>
But now he diagnoses another of the inevitable results
of this sin. After tracing the sin, and the theory of
life which permitted it, to their historical beginnings
at the entry of the people into Canaan, he describes
how the long practice of it, no matter how pretentious
its sanctions, inevitably leads not only to exterminating
strifes, but to the decay of the vigour of the nation,
to barrenness and a diminishing population.</p>

<p><i>Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel, like the
first fruit on a fig-tree in her first season I saw your
fathers.</i> So had the lusty nation appeared to God in
its youth; in that dry wilderness all the sap and
promise of spring were in its eyes, because it was still
pure. But <i>they&mdash;they came to Ba'al-Peor</i>&mdash;the first of the
shrines of Canaan which they touched&mdash;<i>and dedicated
themselves to the Shame, and became as abominable as
the object of their love</i>. <i>Ephraim</i>&mdash;the <i>Fruitful</i> name is
emphasised&mdash;<i>their glory is flown away like a bird. No</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
<i>more birth, no more motherhood, no more conception!</i><a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>
<i>Blasted is Ephraim, withered the root of them, fruit they
produce not: yea, even when they beget children I slay
the darlings of their womb. Yea, though they bring up
their sons I bereave them</i>, till they are <i>poor in men.
Yea, woe upon themselves also, when I look away from
them! Ephraim</i>&mdash;again the <i>Fruitful</i> name is dragged
to the front&mdash;<i>for prey, as I have seen, are his sons
destined.</i><a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> <i>Ephraim</i>&mdash;he <i>must lead his sons to the
slaughter</i>.</p>

<p>And the prophet interrupts with his chorus: <i>Give
them, O LORD&mdash;what wilt Thou give them? Give them
a miscarrying womb and breasts that are dry!</i></p>

<p><i>All their mischief is in Gilgal</i>&mdash;again the Divine voice
strikes the connection between the national worship
and the national sin&mdash;<i>yea, there do I hate them: for the
evil of their doings from My house I will drive them.
I will love them no more: all their nobles are rebels.</i><a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>And again the prophet responds: <i>My God will cast
them away, for they have not hearkened to Him, and they
shall be vagabonds among the nations</i>.</p>

<p>Some of the warnings which Hosea enforces with
regard to this sin have been instinctively felt by
mankind since the beginnings of civilisation, and are
found expressed among the proverbs of nearly all the
languages.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> But I am unaware of any earlier moralist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
in any literature who traced the effects of national
licentiousness in a diminishing population, or who exposed
the persistent delusion of libertine men that they
themselves may resort to vice, yet keep their womankind
chaste. Hosea, so far as we know, was the first
to do this. History in many periods has confirmed
the justice of his observations, and by one strong voice
after another enforced his terrible warnings. The experience
of ancient Persia and Egypt; the languor of
the Greek cities; the "deep weariness and sated
lust" which in Imperial Rome "made human life
a hell"; the decay which overtook Italy after the
renascence of Paganism without the Pagan virtues;
the strife and anarchy that have rent every court
where, as in the case of Henri Quatre, the king set
the example of libertinage; the incompetence, the poltroonery,
the treachery, that have corrupted every camp
where, as in French Metz in 1870, soldiers and officers
gave way so openly to vice; the checks suffered by
modern civilisation in face of barbarism because its
pioneers mingled in vice with the savage races they
were subduing; the number of great statesmen falling
by their passion, and in their fall frustrating the hopes
of nations; the great families worn out by indulgence;
the homes broken up by infidelities; the tainting of the
blood of a new generation by the poisonous practices
of the old,&mdash;have not all these things been in every
age, and do they not still happen near enough to
ourselves to give us a great fear of the sin which
causes them all? Alas! how slow men are to listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
and to lay to heart! Is it possible that we can gild
by the names of frivolity and piquancy habits the
wages of which are death? Is it possible that we can
enjoy comedies which make such things their jest?
We have among us many who find their business in
the theatre, or in some of the periodical literature of
our time, in writing and speaking and exhibiting as
closely as they dare to limits of public decency. When
will they learn that it is not upon the easy edge of
mere conventions that they are capering, but upon the
brink of those eternal laws whose further side is death
and hell&mdash;that it is not the tolerance of their fellow-men
they are testing, but the patience of God Himself?
As for those loud few who claim licence in the name
of art and literature, let us not shrink from them as
if they were strong or their high words true. They
are not strong, they are only reckless; their claims are
lies. All history, the poets and the prophets, whether
Christian or Pagan, are against them. They are traitors
alike to art, to love, and to every other high interest
of mankind.</p>

<p>It may be said that a large part of the art of the
day, which takes great licence in dealing with these
subjects, is exercised only by the ambition to expose that
ruin and decay which Hosea himself affirms. This is
true. Some of the ablest and most popular writers of
our time have pictured the facts, which Hosea describes,
with so vivid a realism that we cannot but
judge them to be inspired to confirm his ancient warnings,
and to excite a disgust of vice in a generation
which otherwise treats vice so lightly. But if so, their
ministry is exceeding narrow, and it is by their side
that we best estimate the greatness of the ancient
prophet. Their transcript of human life may be true to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
the facts it selects, but we find in it no trace of facts
which are greater and more essential to humanity. They
have nothing to tell us of forgiveness and repentance,
and yet these are as real as the things they describe.
Their pessimism is unrelieved. They see the <i>corruption
that is in the world through lust</i>; they forget that
there is an <i>escape</i> from it.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> It is Hosea's greatness that,
while he felt the vices of his day with all needed
thoroughness and realism, he yet never allowed them
to be inevitable or ultimate, but preached repentance
and pardon, with the possibility of holiness even for
his depraved generation. It is the littleness of the
Art of our day that these great facts are forgotten by
her, though once she was their interpreter to men.
When she remembers them the greatness of her past
will return.</p>


<h4>5. <span class="smcap"><a id="Once_More_Puppet-Kings_and_Puppet-Gods"></a>Once More: Puppet-Kings and Puppet-Gods.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> x.</h5>

<p>For another section, the tenth chapter, the prophet
returns to the twin targets of his scorn: the idols
and the puppet-kings. But few notes are needed.
Observe the reiterated connection between the fertility
of the land and the idolatry of the people.</p>

<p><i>A wanton vine is Israel; he lavishes his fruit:</i><a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> <i>the
more his fruit, the more he made his altars; the goodlier</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
<i>his land, the more goodly he made his</i> maççeboth, or
<i>sacred pillars. False is the heart of them: now must
they atone for it. He shall break the neck of their altars;
He shall ruin their pillars. For already they are saying,
No king have we, for we have not feared Jehovah, and
the king&mdash;what could he do for us? Speaking</i><a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> <i>of words,
swearing of false oaths, making of bargains&mdash;till law</i><a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>
<i>breaks out like weeds in the furrows of the field.</i></p>

<p><i>For the Calf of Beth-Aven the inhabitants</i><a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> <i>of Samaria
shall be anxious: yea, mourn for him shall his people,
and his priestlings shall writhe for him&mdash;for his glory
that it is banished from him.</i> In these days of heavy
tribute shall the gold of the golden calf be safe? <i>Yea,
himself shall they pack</i><a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> <i>to Assyria; he shall be offered
as tribute to King Pick-Quarrel.</i><a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> <i>Ephraim shall take
disgrace, and Israel be ashamed because of his counsel.</i><a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>
<i>Undone Samaria! Her king like a chip</i><a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> <i>on the face
of the waters!</i> This may refer to one of the revolutions
in which the king was murdered. But it seems
more appropriate to the final catastrophe of 724-1: the
fall of the kingdom, and the king's banishment to
Assyria. If the latter, the verse has been inserted;
but the following verse would lead us to take these
disasters as still future. <i>And the high places of idolatry
shall be destroyed, the sin of Israel; thorn and thistle
shall come up on their altars. And they shall say to the
mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall on us.</i> It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
cannot be too often repeated: these handmade gods,
these chips of kings, shall be swept away together.</p>

<p>Once more the prophet returns to the ancient origins
of Israel's present sins, and once more to their shirking
of the discipline necessary for spiritual results, but
only that he may lead up as before to the inevitable
doom. <i>From</i><a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> <i>the days of Gibeah thou hast sinned, O
Israel. There have they remained</i>&mdash;never progressed
beyond their position there&mdash;<i>and this without war overtaking
them in Gibeah against the dastards</i>.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> <i>As soon
as I please, I can chastise them, and peoples shall be
gathered against them in chastisement for their double
sin.</i> This can scarcely be, as some suggest, the two
calves at Bethel and Dan. More probably it is still
the idols and the man-made kings. Now he returns
to the ambition of the people for spiritual results without
a spiritual discipline.</p>

<p><i>And Ephraim is a broken-in heifer, that loveth to
thresh.</i><a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> <i>But I have come on her fair neck. I will yoke
Ephraim; Judah must plough; Jacob must harrow for
himself.</i> It is all very well for the unmuzzled beast<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>
to love the threshing, but harder and unrewarded
labours of ploughing and harrowing have to come
before the floor be heaped with sheaves. Israel must
not expect religious festival without religious discipline.
<i>Sow for yourselves righteousness; then shall ye reap the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
<i>fruit of God's leal love.</i><a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> <i>Break up your fallow ground,

for thou didst trust in thy chariots,</i><a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> <i>in the multitude
of thy warriors. For the tumult</i> of war <i>shall arise among
thy tribes,</i><a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> <i>and all thy fenced cities shall be ruined, as
Salman beat to ruin Beth-Arbel</i><a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> <i>in the day of war: the
mother shall be broken on the children</i>&mdash;presumably the
land shall fall with the falling of her cities. <i>Thus shall
I do to you, O house of Israel,</i><a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> <i>because of the evil of your
evil: soon shall the king of Israel be undone&mdash;undone.</i></p>

<p>The political decay of Israel, then, so deeply figured
in all these chapters, must end in utter collapse. Let
us sum up the gradual features of this decay: the
substance of the people scattered abroad; the national
spirit dissipated; the national prestige humbled; the
kings mere puppets; the prophets corrupted; the
national vigour sapped by impurity; the idolatry conscious
of its impotence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE FATHERHOOD AND HUMANITY OF GOD</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> xi.</h5>


<p>From the thick jungle of Hosea's travail, the
eleventh chapter breaks like a high and open
mound. The prophet enjoys the first of his two clear
visions&mdash;that of the Past.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> Judgment continues to
descend. Israel's Sun is near his setting, but before
he sinks&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A lingering light he fondly throws<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the dear hills, whence first he rose."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Across these confused and vicious years, through
which he has painfully made his way, Hosea sees the
tenderness and the romance of the early history of his
people. And although he must strike the old despairing
note&mdash;that, by the insincerity of the present generation,
all the ancient guidance of their God must end in this!&mdash;yet
for some moments the blessed memory shines by
itself, and God's mercy appears to triumph over Israel's
ingratitude. Surely their sun will not set; Love must
prevail. To which assurance a later voice from the
Exile has added, in verses 10 and 11, a confirmation
suitable to its own circumstances.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>When Israel was a child, then I loved him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And from Egypt I called</i> him <i>to be My son.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>
<p>The early history of Israel was a romance. Think
of it historically. Before the Most High there spread
an array of kingdoms and peoples. At their head
were three strong princes&mdash;sons indeed of God, if all
the heritage of the past, the power of the present and
the promise of the future be tokens. Egypt, wrapt in
the rich and jewelled web of centuries, basked by Nile
and Pyramid, all the wonder of the world's art in his
dreamy eyes. Opposite him Assyria, with barer but
more massive limbs, stood erect upon his highlands,
grasping in his sword the promise of the world's power.
Between the two, and using both of them, yet with his
eyes westward on an empire of which neither dreamed,
the Ph&#339;nician on his sea-coast built his storehouses
and sped his navies, the promise of the world's wealth.
It must ever remain the supreme romance of history,
that the true son of God, bearer of His love and
righteousness to all mankind, should be found, not
only outside this powerful trinity, but in the puny and
despised captive of one of them&mdash;in a people that was
not a state, that had not a country, that was without
a history, and, if appearances be true, was as yet
devoid of even the rudiments of civilisation&mdash;a child
people and a slave.</p>

<p>That was the Romance, and Hosea gives us the Grace
which made it. <i>When Israel was a child, then I loved
him.</i> The verb is a distinct impulse: <i>I began, I learned,
to love him</i>. God's eyes, that passed unheeding the
adult princes of the world, fell upon this little slave boy,
and He loved him and gave him a career: <i>from Egypt
I called</i> him <i>to be My son</i>.</p>

<p>Now, historically, it was the persuasion of this which
made Israel. All their distinctiveness and character,
their progress from a level with other nomadic tribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
to the rank of the greatest religious teachers of humanity,
started from the memory of these two facts&mdash;that God
loved them, and that God called them. This was an
unfailing conscience&mdash;the obligation that they were not
their own, the irresistible motive to repentance even
in their utmost backsliding, the unquenchable hope of
a destiny in their direst days of defeat and scattering.</p>

<p>Some, of course, may cavil at the narrow, national
scale on which such a belief was held, but let them
remember that it was held in trust for all mankind.
To snarl that Israel felt this sonship to God only for
themselves, is to forget that it is they who have persuaded
humanity that this is the only kind of sonship
worth claiming. Almost every other nation of antiquity
imagined a filial relation to the deity, but it was either
through some fabulous physical descent, and then often
confined only to kings and heroes, or by some mystical
mingling of the Divine with the human, which was just
as gross and sensuous. Israel alone defined the connection
as a historical and a moral one. <i>The sons of
God are begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
nor of the will of man, but of God.</i><a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> Sonship to God
is something not physical, but moral and historical,
into which men are carried by a supreme awakening
to the Divine love and authority. Israel, it is true, felt
this only in a general way for the nation as a whole;<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>
but their conception of it embraced just those moral
contents which form the glory of Christ's doctrine of
the Divine sonship of the individual. The belief that
God is our Father does not come to us with our carnal
birth&mdash;except in possibility: the persuasion of it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
conferred by our baptism except in so far as that is
Christ's own seal to the fact that God Almighty loves
us and has marked us for His own. To us sonship is
a becoming, not a being&mdash;the awakening of our adult
minds into the surprise of a Father's undeserved mercy,
into the constraint of His authority and the assurance
of the destiny He has laid up for us. It is conferred
by love, and confirmed by duty. Neither has power
brought it, nor wisdom, nor wealth, but it has come
solely with the wonder of the knowledge that God loves
us, and has always loved us, as well as in the sense,
immediately following, of a true vocation to serve Him.
Sonship which is less than this is no sonship at all. But
so much as this is possible to every man through Jesus
Christ. His constant message is that the Father loves
every one of us, and that if we <i>know</i><a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> that love, we
are God's sons indeed. To them who feel it, adoption
into the number and privileges of the sons of God comes
with the amazement and the romance which glorified
God's choice of the child-slave Israel. <i>Behold</i>, they
cry, <i>what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon
us, that we should be called the sons of God</i>.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>But we cannot be loved by God and left where we
are. Beyond the grace there lies the long discipline
and destiny. We are called from servitude to freedom,
from the world to God&mdash;each of us to run a course,
and do a work, which can be done by no one else.
That Israel did not perceive this was God's sore
sorrow with them.</p>

<p><i>The more I</i><a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> <i>called to them, the farther they went from
Me.</i><a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> <i>They to the Ba'alim kept sacrificing, and to images</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
<i>offering incense.</i> But God persevered with grace,
and the story is at first continued in the figure of
Fatherhood with which it commenced; then it changes
to the metaphor of a humane man's goodness to his
beasts. <i>Yet I taught Ephraim to walk, holding them on
Mine arms,</i><a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> <i>but they knew not that I healed them</i>&mdash;presumably
when they fell and hurt themselves. <i>With the
cords of a man I would draw them, with bands of love;
and I was to them as those who lift up the yoke on their
jaws, and gently would I give them to eat.</i><a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> It is the
picture of a team of bullocks, in charge of a kind driver.
Israel are no longer the wanton young cattle of the
previous chapter, which need the yoke firmly fastened
on their neck,<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> but a team of toiling oxen mounting
some steep road. There is no use now for the rough
ropes, by which frisky animals are kept to their work;
but the driver, coming to his beasts' heads, by the
gentle touch of his hand at their mouths and by
words of sympathy <i>draws</i> them after him. <i>I drew them
with cords of a man, and with bands of love.</i> Yet there
is the yoke, and it would seem that certain forms of
this, when beasts were working upwards, as we should
say <i>against the collar</i>, pressed and rubbed upon them,
so that the humane driver, when he came to their
heads, eased the yoke with his hands. <i>I was as they
that take the yoke off their jaws</i>;<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> and then, when they
got to the top of the hill, he would rest and feed them.
That is the picture, and however uncertain we may
feel as to some of its details, it is obviously a passage&mdash;Ewald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
says "the earliest of all passages"&mdash;in which
"human means precisely the same as love." It ought
to be taken along with that other passage in the great
Prophecy of the Exile, where God is described as He
that led them through <i>the deep, as an horse in the
wilderness, that they should not stumble: as a beast goeth
down into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord gave him rest</i>.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>Thus then the figure of the fatherliness of God
changes into that of His gentleness or humanity. Do
not let us think that there is here either any descent
of the poetry or want of connection between the two
figures. The change is true, not only to Israel's, but
to our own experience. Men are all either the eager
children of happy, irresponsible days, or the bounden,
plodding draught-cattle of life's serious burdens and
charges. Hosea's double figure reflects human life
in its whole range. Which of us has not known this
fatherliness of the Most High, exercised upon us, as
upon Israel, throughout our years of carelessness and
disregard? It was God Himself who taught and
trained us then;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When through the slippery paths of youth<br /></span>
<span class="i5">With heedless steps I ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thine arm unseen conveyed me safe,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And led me up to man."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Those speedy recoveries from the blunders of early
wilfulness, those redemptions from the sins of youth&mdash;happy
were we if we knew that it was <i>He who healed
us</i>. But there comes a time when men pass from
leading-strings to harness&mdash;when we feel faith less and
duty more&mdash;when our work touches us more closely than
our God. Death must be a strange transformer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
spirit, yet surely not more strange than life, which out
of the eager buoyant child makes in time the slow
automaton of duty. It is such a stage which the
fourth of these verses suits, when we look up, not so
much for the fatherliness as for the gentleness and
humanity of our God. A man has a mystic power
of a very wonderful kind upon the animals over whom
he is placed. On any of these wintry roads of ours
we may see it, when a kind carter gets down at a hill,
and, throwing the reins on his beast's back, will come
to its head and touch it with his bare hands, and speak
to it as if it were his fellow; till the deep eyes fill with
light, and out of these things, so much weaker than
itself, a touch, a glance, a word, there will come to it
new strength to pull the stranded waggon onward. The
man is as a god to the beast, coming down to help it,
and it almost makes the beast human that he does so.
Not otherwise does Hosea feel the help which God gives
His own on the weary hills of life. We need not
discipline, for our work is discipline enough, and the
cares we carry of themselves keep us straight and
steady. But we need sympathy and gentleness&mdash;this
very humanity which the prophet attributes to our God.
God comes and takes us by the head; through the
mystic power which is above us, but which makes us
like itself, we are lifted to our task. Let no one judge
this incredible. The incredible would be that our God
should prove any less to us than the merciful man is
to his beast. But we are saved from argument by
experience. When we remember how, as life has
become steep and our strength exhausted, there has
visited us a thought which has sharpened to a word, a
word which has warmed to a touch, and we have drawn
ourselves together and leapt up new men, can we feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
that God was any less in these things, than in the
voice of conscience or the message of forgiveness, or
the restraints of His discipline? Nay, though the reins
be no longer felt, God is at our head, that we should
not stumble nor stand still.</p>

<p>Upon this gracious passage there follows one of
those swift revulsions of feeling, which we have learned
almost to expect in Hosea. His insight again overtakes
his love. The people will not respond to the goodness
of their God; it is impossible to work upon minds so
fickle and insincere. Discipline is what they need.
<i>He shall return to the land of Egypt, or Asshur shall
be his king</i> (it is still an alternative), <i>for they have
refused to return</i> to Me....<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> 'Tis but one more instance
of the age-long apostasy of the people. <i>My
people have a bias</i><a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> <i>to turn from Me; and though they</i>
(the prophets) <i>call them upwards, none of them can
lift them</i>.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

<p>Yet God is God, and though prophecy fail He will
attempt His Love once more. There follows the
greatest passage in Hosea&mdash;deepest if not highest of
his book&mdash;the breaking forth of that exhaustless
mercy of the Most High which no sin of man can bar
back nor wear out.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>How am I to give thee up, O Ephraim?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How <i>am I to let thee go, O Israel?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>How am I to give thee up?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Am I to make an Admah of thee&mdash;a &#7778;eboim?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My heart is turned upon Me,</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My compassions begin to boil:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I will not perform the fierceness of Mine anger,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I will not turn to destroy Ephraim;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For God am I and not man,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The Holy One in the midst of thee, yet I come not to consume!</i><a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such a love has been the secret of Hosea's persistence
through so many years with so faithless a
people, and now, when he has failed, it takes voice to
itself and in its irresistible fulness makes this last
appeal. Once more before the end let Israel hear God
in the utterness of His Love!</p>

<p>The verses are a climax, and obviously to be succeeded
by a pause. On the brink of his doom, will
Israel turn to such a God, at such a call? The next
verse, though dependent for its promise on this same
exhaustless Love, is from an entirely different circumstance,
and cannot have been put by Hosea here.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE FINAL ARGUMENT</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> xii.-xiv. 1.</h5>


<p>The impassioned call with which last chapter closed
was by no means an assurance of salvation: <i>How
am I to give thee up, Ephraim? how am I to let thee go,
Israel?</i> On the contrary, it was the anguish of Love,
when it hovers over its own on the brink of the destruction
to which their wilfulness has led them, and before
relinquishing them would seek, if possible, some last
way to redeem. Surely that fatal morrow and the
people's mad leap into it are not inevitable! At least,
before they take the leap, let the prophet go back once
more upon the moral situation of to-day, go back once
more upon the past of the people, and see if he can
find anything else to explain that bias to apostasy<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>
which has brought them to this fatal brink&mdash;anything
else which may move them to repentance even there.
So in chaps. xii. and xiii. Hosea turns upon the now
familiar trail of his argument, full of the Divine jealousy,
determined to give the people one other chance to turn;
but if they will not, he at least will justify God's relinquishment
of them. The chapters throw even a
brighter light upon the temper and habits of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
generation. They again explore Israel's ancient history
for causes of the present decline; and, in especial, they
cite the spiritual experience of the Father of the nation,
as if to show that what of repentance was possible for
him is possible for his posterity also. But once more
all hope is seen to be vain; and Hosea's last travail
with his obstinate people closes in a doom even more
awful than its predecessors.</p>

<p>The division into chapters is probably correct; but
while chap. xiii. is well-ordered and clear, the arrangement,
and in parts the meaning, of chap. xii. are very
obscure.</p>


<h4>1. <span class="smcap"><a id="The_People_and_Their_Father_Jacob"></a>The People and Their Father Jacob.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> xii.</h5>

<p>In no part even of the difficult Book of Hosea does
the sacred text bristle with more problems. It may
well be doubted whether the verses lie in their proper
order, or, if they do, whether we have them entire as
they came from the prophet, for the connection is not
always perceptible.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> We cannot believe, however, that
the chapter is a bundle of isolated oracles, for the
analogy between Jacob and his living posterity runs
through the whole of it,<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> and the refrain that God
must requite upon the nation their deeds is found both
near the beginning and at the end of the chapter.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> One
is tempted to take the two fragments about the Patriarch
(vv. 4, 5, and 13 f.) by themselves, and the more so
that ver. 8 would follow so suitably on either ver. 2 or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
ver. 3. But this clue is not sufficient; and till one
more evident is discovered, it is perhaps best to keep to
the extant arrangement.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>

<p>As before, the argument starts from the falseness of
Israel, which is illustrated in the faithlessness of their
foreign relations. <i>Ephraim hath compassed Me with lies,
and the house of Israel with deceit, and Judah</i> ...<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>
<i>Ephraim herds the wind</i><a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> <i>and hunts the sirocco. All day
long they heap up falsehood and fraud:</i><a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> <i>they strike a
bargain with Assyria, and carry oil to Egypt</i>, as Isaiah
also complained.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p><i>Jehovah hath a quarrel with Israel</i><a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> <i>and is about to
visit upon Jacob his ways; according to his deeds will</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
<i>He requite him. In the womb he supplanted his brother,
and in his man's strength he wrestled with God.</i><a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> <i>Yea,
he wrestled with</i> the <i>Angel and prevailed; he wept and
besought of Him mercy. At Bethel he met with Him, and
there He spake with him</i><a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> (or <i>with us</i>&mdash;that is, in the
person of our father)....<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> <i>So thou by thy God</i>&mdash;by
His help,<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> for no other way is possible except, like thy
father, through wrestling with Him&mdash;<i>shouldest return:
keep leal love and justice, and wait on thy God without
ceasing</i>.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> To this passage we shall return in dealing
with Hosea's doctrine of Repentance.</p>

<p>In characteristic fashion the discourse now swerves
from the ideal to the real state of the people.</p>

<p><i>Canaan!</i> So the prophet nicknames his mercenary
generation.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> <i>With false balances in his hand, he loves
to defraud. For Ephraim said</i>, Ah but <i>I have grown
rich, I have won myself wealth.</i><a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> <i>None of my gains can
touch me with guilt which is sin.</i><a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> <i>But I, Jehovah thy God</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
<i>from the land of Egypt&mdash;I could make thee dwell in tents
again, as in the days of the Assembly</i> in Horeb&mdash;I could
destroy all this commercial civilisation of thine, and
reduce thee to thine ancient level of nomadic life&mdash;<i>and
I spake to the prophets: it was I who multiplied vision,
and by the hand of the prophets gave parables. If Gilead</i>
be for <i>idolatry, then shall it become vanity!</i> If <i>in
Gilgal</i>&mdash;Stone-Circle&mdash;<i>they sacrifice bullocks,</i><a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> <i>stone-heaps
shall their altars become among the furrows of the field.</i>
One does not see the connection of these verses with
the preceding. But now the discourse oscillates once
more to the national father, and the parallel between
his own and his people's experience.</p>

<p><i>And Jacob fled to the land</i><a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> <i>of Aram, and Israel served
for a wife, and for a wife he herded</i> sheep. <i>And by a
prophet Jehovah brought Israel up from Egypt, and by
a prophet he was shepherded. And Ephraim hath given
bitter provocation; but his blood-guiltiness shall be upon
him, and his Lord shall return it to him.</i></p>

<p>I cannot trace the argument here.</p>


<h4>2. <span class="smcap"><a id="The_Last_Judgment"></a>The Last Judgment.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> xiii.-xiv. 1.</h5>

<p>The crisis draws on. On the one hand Israel's sin,
accumulating, bulks ripe for judgment. On the other
the times grow more fatal, or the prophet more than
ever feels them so. He will gather once again the
old truths on the old lines&mdash;the great past when
Jehovah was God alone, the descent to the idols and
the mushroom monarchs of to-day, the people, who
once had been strong, sapped by luxury, forgetful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
stupid, not to be roused. The discourse has every
mark of being Hosea's latest. There is clearness and
definiteness beyond anything since chap. iv. There
are ease and lightness of treatment, a playful sarcasm,
as if the themes were now familiar both to the prophet
and his audience. But, chiefly, there is the passion&mdash;so
suitable to last words&mdash;of how different it all might
have been, if to this crisis Israel had come with store
of strength instead of guilt. How these years, with
their opening into the great history of the world, might
have meant a birth for the nation, which instead was
lying upon them like a miscarried child in the mouth
of the womb! It was a fatality God Himself could
not help in. Only death and hell remained. Let
them, then, have their way! Samaria must expiate
her guilt in the worst horrors of war.</p>

<p>Instead of with one definite historical event, this
last effort of Hosea opens more naturally with a
summary of all Ephraim's previous history. The
tribe had been the first in Israel till they took to
idols.</p>

<p><i>Whenever Ephraim spake there was trembling.</i><a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>
<i>Prince</i><a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> <i>was he in Israel; but he fell into guilt through
the Ba'al, and so&mdash;died. Even now they continue to sin
and make them a smelting of their silver, idols after their
own model,</i><a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> <i>smith's work all of it. To them</i>&mdash;to such
things&mdash;<i>they speak! Sacrificing men kiss calves!</i> In
such unreason have they sunk. They cannot endure.
<i>Therefore shall they be like the morning cloud and like
the dew that early vanisheth, like chaff which whirleth
up from the floor and like smoke from the window. And</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
<i>I was thy God</i><a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> <i>from the land of Egypt; and god besides
Me thou knowest not, nor saviour has there been any but
Myself. I shepherded</i><a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> <i>thee in the wilderness, in the
land of droughts</i>&mdash;long before they came among the
gods of fertile Canaan. But once they came hither,
<i>the more pasture they had, the more they ate themselves
full, and the more they ate themselves full, the more was
their heart uplifted, so they forgat Me. So that I must
be</i><a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> <i>to them like a lion, like a leopard on the way I must
leap.</i><a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> <i>I will fall on them like a bear robbed of its young,
and will tear the caul of their hearts, and will devour
them like a lion&mdash;wild beasts shall rend them.</i><a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

<p>When <i>He hath destroyed thee, O Israel&mdash;who then
may help thee?</i><a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> <i>Where is thy king now? that he may
save thee, or all thy princes? that they may rule thee;</i><a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
<i>those of whom thou hast said, Give me a king and
princes.</i> Aye, <i>I give thee a king in Mine anger, and I
take him away in My wrath!</i> Fit summary of the short
and bloody reigns of these last years.</p>

<p><i>Gathered is Ephraim's guilt, stored up is his sin.</i> The
nation is pregnant&mdash;but with guilt! <i>Birth pangs seize
him, but</i>&mdash;the figure changes, with Hosea's own swiftness,
from mother to child&mdash;<i>he is an impracticable son;</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>
<i>for</i> this <i>is no time to stand in the mouth of the
womb</i>. The years that might have been the nation's
birth are by their own folly to prove their death.
Israel lies in the way of its own redemption&mdash;how
truly this has been forced home upon them in one
chapter after another! Shall God then step in and
work a deliverance on the brink of death? <i>From the
hand of Sheol shall I deliver them? from death shall I
redeem them?</i> Nay, let death and Sheol have their
way. <i>Where are thy plagues, O death? where thy
destruction, Sheol?</i> Here with them. <i>Compassion is
hid from Mine eyes.</i></p>

<p>This great verse has been very variously rendered.
Some have taken it as a promise: <i>I will deliver ...
I will redeem....</i> So the Septuagint translated, and
St. Paul borrowed, not the whole Greek verse, but its
spirit and one or two of its terms, for his triumphant
challenge to death in the power of the Resurrection of
Christ.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> As it stands in Hosea, however, the verse
must be a threat. The last clause unambiguously
abjures mercy, and the statement that His people will
not be saved, for God cannot save them, is one in
thorough harmony with all Hosea's teaching.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p>An appendix follows with the illustration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
exact form which doom shall take. As so frequently
with Hosea, it opens with a play upon the people's
name, which at the same time faintly echoes the
opening of the chapter.</p>

<p><i>Although he among his brethren</i><a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> <i>is the fruit-bearer</i>&mdash;yaphri',
he Ephraim&mdash;<i>there shall come an east wind, a
wind of Jehovah rising from the wilderness, so that his
fountain dry up and his spring be parched</i>. He&mdash;<i>himself</i>,
not the Assyrian, but Menahem, who had to send gold
to the Assyrian&mdash;<i>shall strip the treasury of all its precious
jewels. Samaria must bear her guilt: for she hath
rebelled against her God.</i> To this simple issue has the
impenitence of the people finally reduced the many
possibilities of those momentous years; and their last
prophet leaves them looking forward to the crash which
came some dozen years later in the invasion and
captivity of the land. <i>They shall fall by the sword; their
infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with
child ripped up.</i> Horrible details, but at that period
certain to follow every defeat in war.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

<h3>"<i>I WILL BE AS THE DEW</i>"</h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> xiv. 2-10.</h5>


<p>Like the Book of Amos, the Book of Hosea,
after proclaiming the people's inevitable doom,
turns to a blessed prospect of their restoration to
favour with God. It will be remembered that we
decided against the authenticity of such an epilogue
in the Book of Amos; and it may now be asked, how
can we come to any other conclusion with regard to the
similar peroration in the Book of Hosea? For the
following reasons.</p>

<p>We decided against the genuineness of the closing
verses of Amos, because their sanguine temper is
opposed to the temper of the whole of the rest of the
book, and because they neither propose any ethical
conditions for the attainment of the blessed future,
nor in their picture of the latter do they emphasise one
single trace of the justice, or the purity, or the social
kindliness, on which Amos has so exclusively insisted
as the ideal relations of Israel to Jehovah. It seemed
impossible to us that Amos could imagine the perfect
restoration of his people in the terms only of requickened
nature, and say nothing about righteousness, truth and
mercy towards the poor. The prospect which now
closes his book is psychologically alien to him, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
being painted in the terms of later prophecy, may be
judged to have been added by some prophet of the
Exile, speaking from the standpoint, and with the
legitimate desires, of his own day.</p>

<p>But the case is very different for this epilogue in
Hosea. In the first place, Hosea has not only continually
preached repentance, and been, from his whole
affectionate temper of mind, unable to believe repentance
impossible; but he has actually predicted the restoration
of his people upon certain well-defined and ethical
conditions. In chap. ii. he has drawn for us in detail
the whole prospect of God's successful treatment
of his erring spouse. Israel should be weaned from
their sensuousness and its accompanying trust in idols
by a severe discipline, which the prophet describes in
terms of their ancient wanderings in the wilderness.
They should be reduced, as at the beginning of their
history, to moral converse with their God; and abjuring
the Ba'alim (later chapters imply also their foreign
allies and foolish kings and princes) should return to
Jehovah, when He, having proved that these could not
give them the fruits of the land they sought after,
should Himself quicken the whole course of nature to
bless them with the fertility of the soil and the friendliness
even of the wild beasts.</p>

<p>Now in the epilogue and its prospect of Israel's
repentance we find no feature, physical or moral,
which has not already been furnished by these previous
promises of the book. All their ethical conditions are
provided; nothing but what they have conceived of
blessing is again conceived. Israel is to abjure senseless
sacrifice and come to Jehovah with rational and
contrite confession.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> She is to abjure her foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
alliances.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> She is to trust in the fatherly love of her
God.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> He is to heal her,<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> and His anger is to turn
away.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> He is to restore nature, just as described in
chap. ii., and the scenery of the restoration is borrowed
from Hosea's own Galilee. There is, in short, no
phrase or allusion of which we can say that it is alien
to the prophet's style or environment, while the very
keynotes of his book&mdash;<i>return, backsliding, idols the
work of our hands, such pity as a father hath</i>, and perhaps
even the <i>answer</i> or <i>converse</i> of verse 9&mdash;are all struck
once more.</p>

<p>The epilogue then is absolutely different from the
epilogue to the Book of Amos, nor can the present
expositor conceive of the possibility of a stronger case
for the genuineness of any passage of Scripture. The
sole difficulty seems to be the place in which we find
it&mdash;a place where its contradiction to the immediately
preceding sentence of doom is brought out into relief.
We need not suppose, however, that it was uttered by
Hosea in immediate proximity to the latter, nor even
that it formed his last word to Israel. But granting
only (as the above evidence obliges us to do) that it is
the prophet's own, this fourteenth chapter may have
been a discourse addressed by him at one of those
many points when, as we know, he had some hope of
the people's return. Personally, I should think it
extremely likely that Hosea's ministry closed with that
final, hopeless proclamation in chap. xiii.: no other
conclusion was possible so near the fall of Samaria,
and the absolute destruction of the Northern Kingdom.
But Hosea had already in chap. ii. painted the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
opposite issue as a possible ideal for his people; and
during some break in those years when their insincerity
was less obtrusive, and the final doom still uncertain,
the prophet's heart swung to its natural pole in the
exhaustless and steadfast love of God, and he uttered
his unmingled gospel. That either himself or the
unknown editor of his prophecies should have placed
it at the very end of his book is not less than what we
might have expected. For if the book were to have
validity beyond the circumstances of its origin, beyond
the judgment which was so near and so inevitable, was
it not right to let something else than the proclamation
of this latter be its last word to men? was it not
right to put as the conclusion of the whole matter the
ideal eternally valid for Israel&mdash;the gospel which is
ever God's last word to His people?<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<p>At some point or other, then, in the course of his
ministry, there was granted to Hosea an open vision
like to the vision which he has recounted in the second
chapter. He called on the people to repent. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
once, and in the power of that Love to which he had
already said all things are possible, it seemed to him as
if repentance came. The tangle and intrigue of his
generation fell away; fell away the reeking sacrifices
and the vain show of worship. The people turned from
their idols and puppet-kings, from Assyria and from
Egypt, and with contrite hearts came to God Himself,
who, healing and loving, opened to them wide the gates
of the future. It is not strange that down this spiritual
vista the prophet should see the same scenery as daily
filled his bodily vision. Throughout Galilee Lebanon<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>
dominates the landscape. You cannot lift your eyes from
any spot of Northern Israel without resting them upon
the vast mountain. From the unhealthy jungles of
the Upper Jordan, the pilgrim lifts his heart to the
cool hill air above, to the ever-green cedars and firs,
to the streams and waterfalls that drop like silver chains
off the great breastplate of snow. From Esdraelon
and every plain the peasants look to Lebanon to
store the clouds and scatter the rain; it is not from
heaven but from Hermon that they expect the dew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
their only hope in the long drought of summer.
Across Galilee and in Northern Ephraim, across
Bashan and in Northern Gilead, across Hauran and
on the borders of the desert, the mountain casts its
spell of power, its lavish promise of life.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> Lebanon
is everywhere the summit of the land, and there are
points from which it is as dominant as heaven.</p>

<p>No wonder then that our northern prophet painted
the blessed future in the poetry of the Mountain&mdash;its
air, its dew and its trees. Other seers were to behold,
in the same latter days, the mountain of the Lord above
the tops of the mountains; the ordered city, her steadfast
walls salvation, and her open gates praise; the
wealth of the Gentiles flowing into her, profusion of
flocks for sacrifice, profusion of pilgrims; the great
Temple and its solemn services; and <i>the glory of Lebanon
shall come unto thee, fir-tree and pine and box-tree together,
to beautify the place of My Sanctuary</i>.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> But, with his
home in the north, and weary of sacrifice and ritual,
weary of everything artificial whether it were idols or
puppet-kings, Hosea turns to the <i>glory of Lebanon</i> as
it lies, untouched by human tool or art, fresh and full
of peace from God's own hand. Like that other seer
of Galilee, Hosea in his vision of the future <i>saw no
temple therein</i>.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> His sacraments are the open air, the
mountain breeze, the dew, the vine, the lilies, the pines;
and what God asks of men are not rites nor sacrifices,
but life and health, fragrance and fruitfulness, beneath
the shadow and the Dew of His Presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Return, O Israel, to Jehovah thy God, for thou hast

forced to some critics, who have proposed various
emendations, such as "like the fast-rooted trees of
Lebanon,"<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> but any one who has seen how the mountain

<p>This version is not without its difficulties; but the
alternative that God is addressed and Ephraim is the
speaker&mdash;<i>Ephraim</i> says, <i>What have I to do any more
with idols? I answer and look to Him: I am like a

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> <i>passim</i>.</h5>


<p>We have now finished the translation and detailed
exposition of Hosea's prophecies. We have
followed his minute examination of his people's character;
his criticism of his fickle generation's attempts to
repent; and his presentation of true religion in contrast
to their shallow optimism and sensual superstitions.
We have seen an inwardness and spirituality of the
highest kind&mdash;a love not only warm and mobile, but
nobly jealous, and in its jealousy assisted by an
extraordinary insight and expertness in character.
Why Hosea should be distinguished above all prophets
for inwardness and spirituality must by this time be
obvious to us. From his remote watchfulness, Amos
had seen the nations move across the world as the
stars across heaven; had seen, within Israel, class
distinct from class, and given types of all: rich and
poor; priest, merchant and judge; the panic-stricken,
the bully; the fraudulent and the unclean. The observatory
of Amos was the world, and the nation. But
Hosea's was the home; and there he had watched a
human soul decay through every stage from innocence
to corruption. It was a husband's study of a wife
which made Hosea the most inward of all the prophets.
This was <i>the beginning of God's word by him</i>.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>
<p>Among the subjects in the subtle treatment of which
Hosea's service to religion is most original and conspicuous,
there are especially three that deserve
a more detailed treatment than we have been able
to give them. These are the Knowledge of God,
Repentance and the Sin against Love. We may devote
a chapter to each of them, beginning in this with the
most characteristic and fundamental truth Hosea gave
to religion&mdash;the Knowledge of God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If to the heart there be one pain more fatal than
another, it is the pain of not being understood. That
prevents argument: how can you reason with one who
will not come to quarters with your real self? It
paralyses influence: how can you do your best with
one who is blind to your best? It stifles Love; for
how dare she continue to speak when she is mistaken
for something else? Here as elsewhere "against
stupidity the gods themselves fight in vain."</p>

<p>This anguish Hosea had suffered. As closely as
two souls may live on earth, he had lived with Gomer.
Yet she had never wakened to his worth. She must
have been a woman with a power of love, or such a
heart had hardly wooed her. He was a man of deep
tenderness and exquisite powers of expression. His
tact, his delicacy, his enthusiasm are sensible in every
chapter of his book. Gomer must have tasted them
all before Israel did. Yet she never knew him. It
was her curse that, being married, she was not awake
to the meaning of marriage, and, being married to
Hosea, she never appreciated the holy tenderness and
heroic patience which were deemed by God not unworthy
of becoming a parable of His own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>Now I think we do not go far wrong if we conclude
that it was partly this long experience of a soul that
loved, but had neither conscience nor ideal in her love,
which made Hosea lay such frequent and pathetic
emphasis upon Israel's <i>ignorance</i> of Jehovah. To have
his character ignored, his purposes baffled, his gifts
unappreciated, his patience mistaken&mdash;this was what
drew Hosea into that wonderful sympathy with the
heart of God towards Israel which comes out in such
passionate words as these: <i>My people perish for lack
of knowledge.</i><a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> <i>There is no troth, nor leal love, nor
knowledge of God in the land.</i><a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> <i>They have not known
the Lord.</i><a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> <i>She did not know that I gave her corn and
wine.</i><a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> <i>They knew not that I healed them.</i><a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> <i>For now,
because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will reject thee.</i><a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>
<i>I will have leal love and not sacrifice, and the knowledge
of God rather than burnt-offerings.</i><a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> Repentance consists
in change of knowledge. And the climax of the
new life which follows is again knowledge: <i>I will
betroth thee to Me, and thou shall know the Lord.</i><a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> <i>Israel
shall cry, My God, we know Thee.</i><a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></p>

<p>To understand what Hosea meant by knowledge we
must examine the singularly supple word which his
language lent him to express it. The Hebrew root
"Yadh'a,"<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> almost exclusively rendered in the Old
Testament by the English verb to know, is employed
of the many processes of knowledge, for which richer
languages have separate terms. It is by turns to perceive,
be aware of, recognise, understand or conceive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
experience and be expert in.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> But there is besides
nearly always a practical effectiveness, and in connection
with religious objects a moral consciousness.</p>

<p>The barest meaning is to be aware that something is
present or has happened, and perhaps the root meant
simply to see.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> But it was the frequent duty of the
prophets to mark the difference between perceiving a
thing and laying it to heart. Isaiah speaks of the
people <i>seeing</i>, but not so as <i>to know</i>;<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> and Deuteronomy
renders the latter sense by adding <i>with the heart</i>, which
to the Hebrews was the seat, not of the feeling, but of
the practical intellect:<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> <i>And thou knowest with thy heart
that as a man chastiseth his son, so the Lord your God
chastiseth you</i>.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> Usually, however, the word <i>know</i>
suffices by itself. This practical vigour naturally developed
in such directions as <i>intimacy</i>, <i>conviction</i>,
<i>experience</i> and <i>wisdom</i>. Job calls his familiars <i>my
knowers</i>;<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> of a strong conviction he says, <i>I know that
my Redeemer liveth</i>,<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> and referring to wisdom, <i>We are
of yesterday and know not</i>;<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> while Ecclesiastes says,
<i>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know</i>&mdash;that is,
<i>experience</i>, or <i>suffer&mdash;no evil</i>.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> But the verb rises into a
practical sense&mdash;to the knowledge that leads a man to
regard or care for its object. Job uses the verb <i>know</i>
when he would say, <i>I do not care for my life</i>;<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
the description of the sons of Eli, that <i>they were sons of
Belial, and did not know God</i>, it means that they did not
have any regard for Him.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> Finally, there is a moral
use of the word in which it approaches the meaning
of conscience: <i>Their eyes were opened, and they knew
that they were naked</i>.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> They were aware of this before,
but they felt it now with a new sense. Also it is the
mark of the awakened and the fullgrown to know, or
to feel, the difference between good and evil.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we have a word for <i>knowing</i>, the utterance
of which almost invariably starts a moral echo,
whose very sound, as it were, is haunted by sympathy
and by duty. It is knowledge, not as an effort of, so
much as an effect upon, the mind. It is not <i>to know</i>
so as to see the fact of, but <i>to know</i> so as to feel the
force of; knowledge, not as acquisition and mastery,
but as impression, passion. To quote Paul's distinction,
it is not so much the apprehending as the being apprehended.
It leads to a vivid result&mdash;either warm
appreciation or change of mind or practical effort. It
is sometimes the talent conceived as the trust, sometimes
the enlistment of all the affections. It is
knowledge that is followed by shame, or by love, or
by reverence, or by the sense of a duty. One sees
that it closely approaches the meaning of our "conscience,"
and understands how easily there was developed
from it the evangelical name for repentance,
Metanoia&mdash;that is, change of mind under a new impression
of facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>There are three writers who thus use knowledge
as the key to the Divine life&mdash;in the Old Testament
Hosea and the author of Deuteronomy, in the New
Testament St. John. We likened Amos to St. John
the Baptist: it is not only upon his similar temperament,
but far more upon his use of the word knowledge
for spiritual purposes, that we may compare Hosea to
St. John the Evangelist.</p>

<p>Hosea's chief charge against the people is one of
stupidity. High and low they are <i>a people without
intelligence</i>.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> Once he defines this as want of political
wisdom: <i>Ephraim is a silly dove without heart</i>, or,
as we should say, <i>without brains</i>;<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> and again, as
insensibility to every ominous fact: <i>Strangers have
devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not; yea, grey
hairs are scattered upon him, and he knoweth it not</i>,<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> or,
as we should say, <i>lays it not to heart</i>.</p>

<p>But Israel's most fatal ignorance is of God Himself.
This is the sign and the cause of every one of their
defects. <i>There is no troth, nor leal love, nor knowledge
of God in the land.</i><a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> <i>They have not known the LORD.</i><a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>
<i>They have not known Me.</i></p>

<p>With the causes of this ignorance the prophet has
dealt most explicitly in the fourth chapter.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> They
are two: the people's own vice and the negligence of
their priests. Habitual vice destroys a people's brains.
<i>Harlotry, wine and new wine take away the heart of My
people.</i><a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Lust, for instance, blinds them to the domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
consequences of their indulgence in the heathen
worship, <i>and so the stupid people come to their end</i>.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>
Again, their want of political wisdom is due to their
impurity, drunkenness and greed to be rich.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> Let
those take heed who among ourselves insist that art is
independent of moral conditions&mdash;that wit and fancy
reach their best and bravest when breaking from any
law of decency. They lie: such licence corrupts the
natural intelligence of a people, and robs them of
insight and imagination.</p>

<p>Yet Hosea sees that all the fault does not lie with
the common people. Their teachers are to blame,
priest and prophet alike, for both <i>stumble</i>, and it is true
that a people shall be like its priests.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> <i>The</i> priests
<i>have rejected knowledge and forgotten the Torah</i> of their
God; they think only of the ritual of sacrifice and the
fines by which they fill their mouths. It was, as we have
seen, <i>the</i> sin of Israel's religion in the eighth century.
To the priests religion was a mass of ceremonies
which satisfied the people's superstitions and kept
themselves in bread. To the prophets it was an
equally sensuous, an equally mercenary ecstasy. But
to Hosea religion is above all a thing of the intellect
and conscience: it is that <i>knowing</i> which is at once
common-sense, plain morality and the recognition by
a pure heart of what God has done and is doing in
history. Of such a knowledge the priests and prophets
are the stewards, and it is because they have ignored
their trust that the people have been provided with
no antidote to the vices that corrupt their natural
intelligence and make them incapable of seeing God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>In contrast to such ignorance Hosea describes the
essential temper and contents of a true understanding
of God. Using the word <i>knowledge</i>, in the passive
sense characteristic of his language, not so much the
acquisition as the impression of facts, an impression
which masters not only a man's thoughts but his heart
and will, Hosea describes the <i>knowledge of God</i> as
feeling, character and conscience. Again and again
he makes it parallel to loyalty, repentance, love and
service. Again and again he emphasises that it comes
from God Himself. It is not something which men
can reach by their own endeavours, or by the mere
easy turning of their fickle hearts. For it requires
God Himself to speak, and discipline to chasten.
The only passage in which the knowledge of God is
described as the immediate prize of man's own pursuit
is that prayer of the people on whose facile religiousness
Hosea pours his scorn.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> <i>Let us know, let us
follow on to know the Lord</i>, he heard them say, and
promise themselves, <i>As soon as we seek Him we shall
find Him</i>. But God replies that He can make nothing
of such ambitions; they will pass away like the morning
cloud and the early dew.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> This discarded prayer,
then, is the only passage in the book in which the
knowledge of God is described as man's acquisition.
Elsewhere, in strict conformity to the temper of the
Hebrew word to know, Hosea presents the knowledge
of the Most High, not as something man finds out for
himself, but something which comes down on him
from above.</p>

<p>The means which God took to impress Himself upon
the heart of His people were, according to Hosea, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
events of their history. Hosea, indeed, also points to
another means. <i>The Torah of thy God</i>, which in one
passage<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> he makes parallel to <i>knowledge</i>, is evidently
the body of instruction, judicial, ceremonial and social,
which has come down by the tradition of the priests.
This was not all oral; part of it at least was already
codified in the form we now know as the Book of the
Covenant.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> But Hosea treats of the Torah only in
connection with the priests. And the far more frequent
and direct means by which God has sought to reveal
Himself to the people are the great events of their
past. These Hosea never tires of recalling. More
than any other prophet, he recites the deeds done by
God in the origins and making of Israel. So numerous
are his references that from them alone we could almost
rebuild the early history. Let us gather them together.
The nation's father Jacob <i>in the womb overreached his
brother, and in his manhood strove with God; yea, he
strove with the Angel and he overcame</i>,<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> <i>he wept and supplicated
Him; at Bethel he found Him, and there He spake
with us&mdash;Jehovah God of Hosts, Jehovah is His name</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>
<i>... And Jacob fled to the territory</i><a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> <i>of Aram, and he
served for a wife, and for a wife he tended sheep.
And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of
Egypt, and by a prophet he was tended.</i><a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> <i>When Israel
was young,</i><a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> <i>then I came to love him, and out of Egypt
I called My son.</i><a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> <i>As often as I called to them, so often
did they go from Me:</i><a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> <i>they to the Ba'alim kept sacrificing,
and to images offering incense. But I taught
Ephraim to walk, taking him upon Mine</i><a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> <i>arms, and
they did not know that I nursed them.</i><a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> ... <i>Like grapes
in the wilderness I found Israel, like the firstfruits on an
early fig-tree I saw your fathers; but they went to Ba'al-Peor,
and consecrated themselves to the Shame.</i><a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> ... <i>But
I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, and gods
besides Me thou knowest not, and Saviour there is none
but Me. I knew thee in the wilderness, in the land of
burning heats. But the more pasture they had, the more
they fed themselves full; as they fed themselves full their
heart was lifted up: therefore they forgat Me.</i><a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> ... <i>I
Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt.</i><a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> And all this
revelation of God was not only in that marvellous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
history, but in the yearly gifts of nature and even in
the success of the people's commerce: <i>She knew not that
it was I who have given her the corn and the wine and
the oil, and silver have I multiplied to her.</i><a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<p>This, then, is how God gave Israel knowledge of
Himself. <i>First</i> it broke upon the Individual, the
Nation's Father. And to him it had not come by
miracle, but just in the same fashion as it has broken
upon men from then until now. He woke to find God
no tradition, but an experience. Amid the strife with
others of which life for all so largely consists, Jacob
became aware that God also has to be reckoned with,
and that, hard as is the struggle for bread and love and
justice with one's brethren and fellow-men, with the
Esaus and with the Labans, a more inevitable wrestle
awaits the soul when it is left alone in the darkness
with the Unseen. Oh, this is our sympathy with those
early patriarchs, not that they saw the sea dry up
before them or the bush ablaze with God, but that
upon some lonely battle-field of the heart they also
endured those moments of agony, which imply a more
real Foe than we ever met in flesh and blood, and
which leave upon us marks deeper than the waste of
toil or the rivalry of the world can inflict. So the
Father of the Nation came to <i>find</i> God at Bethel, and
there, adds Hosea, where the Nation still worship, God
<i>spake with us</i><a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> in the person of our Father.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> stage of the knowledge of God was when
the Nation awoke to His leading, and <i>through a prophet</i>,
Moses, were <i>brought up out of Egypt</i>. Here again no
miracle is adduced by Hosea, but with full heart he
appeals to the grace and the tenderness of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
story. To him it is a wonderful romance. Passing by
all the empires of earth, the Almighty chose for Himself
this people that was no people, this tribe that were
the slaves of Egypt. And the choice was of love only:
<i>When Israel was young I came to love him, and out of
Egypt I called My son.</i> It was the adoption of a little
slave-boy, adoption by the heart; and the fatherly
figure continues, <i>I taught Ephraim to walk, taking him
upon Mine arms</i>. It is just the same charm, seen from
another point of view, when Hosea hears God say that
He had <i>found Israel like grapes in the wilderness, like
the firstfruits on an early fig-tree I saw your fathers</i>.</p>

<p>Now these may seem very imperfect figures of the
relation of God to this one people, and the ideas they
present may be felt to start more difficulties than
ever their poetry could soothe to rest: as, for instance,
why Israel alone was chosen&mdash;why this of all tribes
was given such an opportunity to know the Most High.
With these questions prophecy does not deal, and for
Israel's sake had no need to deal. What alone Hosea
is concerned with is the Character discernible in the
origin and the liberation of his people. He hears that
Character speak for itself; and it speaks of a love and
of a joy, to find figures for which it goes to childhood
and to spring&mdash;to the love a man feels for a child, to the
joy a man feels at the sight of the firstfruits of the year.
As the human heart feels in those two great dawns,
when nothing is yet impossible, but all is full of hope
and promise, so humanly, so tenderly, so joyfully had
God felt towards His people. Never again say that
the gods of Greece were painted more living or more
fair! The God of Israel is Love and Springtime to
His people. Grace, patience, pure joy of hope and
possibility&mdash;these are the Divine elements which this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
spiritual man, Hosea, sees in the early history of his
people, and not the miraculous, about which, from end
to end of his book, he is utterly silent.</p>

<p>It is ignorance, then, of such a Character, so evident
in these facts of their history, with which Hosea charges
his people&mdash;not ignorance of the facts themselves, not
want of devotion to their memory, for they are a people
who crowd the sacred scenes of the past, at Bethel, at
Gilgal, at Beersheba, but ignorance of the Character
which shines through the facts. Hosea also calls it
forgetfulness, for the people once had knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> The
cause of their losing it has been their prosperity in
Canaan: <i>As their pastures were increased they grew
satisfied; as they grew satisfied their heart was lifted up,
and therefore they forgat Me.</i><a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p>Equally instructive is the method by which Hosea
seeks to move Israel from this oblivion and bring them
to a true knowledge of God. He insists that their
recovery can only be the work of God Himself&mdash;the
living God working in their lives to-day as He did
in the past of the nation. To those past deeds it is
useless for this generation to go back, and seek again
the memory of which they have disinherited themselves.
Let them rather realise that the same God still lives.
The knowledge of Him may be recovered by appreciating
His deeds in the life of to-day. And these deeds must
first of all be violence and terror, if only to rouse them
from their sensuous sloth. The last verse we have
quoted, about Israel's complacency and pride, is followed
by this terrible one: <i>I shall be</i><a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> <i>to them like a lion, like a</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
<i>leopard I shall leap</i><a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> <i>upon the way. I will meet them as
a bear bereft</i> of her cubs, <i>that I may tear the caul of
their heart, that I may devour them there like a lion: the
wild beast shall rend them.</i><a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> This means that into
Israel's insensibility to Himself God must break with
facts, with wounds, with horrors they cannot evade.
Till He so acts, their own efforts, <i>then shall we know if
we hunt up to know</i>,<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> and their assurance, <i>My God, we
do know Thee</i>,<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> are very vain. Hosea did not speak
for nothing. Events were about to happen more
momentous than even the Exodus and the Conquest
of the Land. By 734 the Assyrians had depopulated
Gilead and Galilee; in 725 the capital itself was invested,
and by 721 the whole nation carried into
captivity. God had made Himself known.</p>

<p>We are already aware, however, that Hosea did not
count this as God's final revelation to His people.
Doom is not doom to him, as it was to Amos, but
discipline; and God withdraws His people from their
fascinating land only that He may have them more
closely to Himself. He will bring His Bride into
the wilderness again, the wilderness where they first
met, and there, when her soul is tender and her stupid
heart broken, He will plant in her again the seeds of
His knowledge and His love. The passages which
describe this are among the most beautiful of the book.
They tell us of no arbitrary conquest of Israel by
Jehovah, of no magic and sudden transformation.
They describe a process as natural and gentle as a
human wooing; they use, as we have seen, the very
terms of this: <i>I will woo her, bring her into the wilderness,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
<i>and speak home to her heart.... And it shall be
in that day that thou shalt call Me, My husband, ...
and I will betroth thee to Me for ever in righteousness and
in justice, and in leal love and in mercies and in faithfulness;
and thou shalt know Jehovah.</i><a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

<h3><i>REPENTANCE</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> <i>passim</i>.</h5>


<p>If we keep in mind what Hosea meant by knowledge&mdash;a
new impression of facts implying a change both
of temper and of conduct&mdash;we shall feel how natural it
is to pass at once from his doctrine of knowledge to
his doctrine of repentance. Hosea may be accurately
styled the first preacher of repentance yet so thoroughly
did he deal with this subject of eternal interest to the
human heart, that between him and ourselves almost
no teacher has increased the insight with which it has
been examined, or the passion with which it ought to
be enforced.</p>

<p>One thing we must hold clear from the outset. To
us repentance is intelligible only in the individual.
There is no motion of the heart which more clearly
derives its validity from its personal character. Repentance
is the conscience, the feeling, the resolution of a
man by himself and for himself&mdash;"<i>I</i> will arise and
go to my Father." Yet it is not to the individual
that Hosea directs his passionate appeals. For him
and his age the religious unit was not the Israelite
but Israel. God had called and covenanted with the
nation as a whole; He had revealed Himself through
their historical fortunes and institutions. His grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
was shown in their succour and guidance as a people;
His last judgment was threatened in their destruction
as a state. So similarly, when by Hosea God calls to
repentance, it is the whole nation whom He addresses.</p>

<p>At the same time we must remember those qualifications
which we adduced with regard to Hosea's
doctrine of the nation's knowledge of God.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> They
affect also his doctrine of the national repentance.
Hosea's experience of Israel had been preceded by his
experience of an Israelite. For years the prophet had
carried on his anxious heart a single human character&mdash;lived
with her, travailed for her, pardoned and redeemed
her. As we felt that this long cure of a soul must have
helped Hosea to his very spiritual sense of the knowledge
of God, so now we may justly assume that the
same cannot have been without effect upon his very
personal teaching about repentance. But with his
experience of Gomer, there conspired also his intense
love for Israel. A warm patriotism necessarily personifies
its object. To the passionate lover of his
people, their figure rises up one and individual&mdash;his
mother, his lover, his wife. Now no man ever loved
his people more intimately or more tenderly than Hosea
loved Israel. The people were not only dear to him,
because he was their son, but dear and vivid also for
their loneliness and their distinction among the peoples
of the earth, and for their long experience as the
intimate of the God of grace and lovingkindness.
God had chosen this Israel as His Bride; and the
remembrance of the unique endowment and lonely
destiny stimulated Hosea's imagination in the work of
personifying and individualising his people. He treats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
Israel with the tenderness and particularity with which
the Shepherd, leaving the ninety and nine in the wilderness,
seeks till He find it the one lost lamb. His
analysis of his fickle generation's efforts to repent, of
their motives in turning to God, and of their failures, is
as inward and definite as if it were a single heart
he were dissecting. Centuries have passed; the individual
has displaced the nation; the experience of
the human heart has been infinitely increased, and
prophecy and all preaching has grown more and more
personal. Yet it has scarcely ever been found either
necessary to add to the terms which Hosea used for
repentance, or possible to go deeper in analysing the
processes which these denote.</p>

<p>Hosea's most simple definition of repentance is that
<i>of returning unto God</i>. For <i>turning</i> and <i>re-turning</i> the
Hebrew language has only one verb&mdash;shûbh. In the
Book of Hosea there are instances in which it is employed
in the former sense;<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> but, even apart from its
use for repentance, the verb usually means to return.
Thus the wandering wife in the second chapter says,
<i>I will return to my former husband</i>;<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> and in the threat
of judgment it is said, <i>Ephraim will return to Egypt</i>.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>
Similar is the sense in the phrases <i>His deeds will I
turn back upon him</i><a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> and <i>I will not turn back to destroy
Ephraim</i>.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> The usual meaning of the verb is therefore,
not merely to turn or change, but to turn right round,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
to turn back and home.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> This is obviously the force
of its employment to express repentance. For this
purpose Hosea very seldom uses it alone.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> He generally
adds either the name by which God had always
been known, Jehovah,<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> or the designation of Him, as
<i>their own God</i>.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>We must emphasise this point if we would appreciate
the thoroughness of our prophet's doctrine, and its
harmony with the preaching of the New Testament.
To Hosea repentance is no mere change in the direction
of one's life. It is a turning back upon one's self, a
retracing of one's footsteps, a confession and acknowledgment
of what one has abandoned. It is a coming
back and a coming home to God, exactly as Jesus
Himself has described in the Parable of the Prodigal.
As Hosea again and again affirms, the Return to God,
like the New Testament Metanoia, is the effect of new
knowledge; but the new knowledge is not of new facts&mdash;it
is of facts which have been present for a long time
and which ought to have been appreciated before.</p>

<p>Of these facts Hosea describes three kinds: the
nation's misery, the unspeakable grace of their God,
and their great guilt in turning from Him. Again it is
as in the case of the prodigal: his hunger, his father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
and his cry, "I have sinned against heaven and in thy
sight."</p>

<p>We have already felt the pathos of those passages
in which Hosea describes the misery and the decay
of Israel, the unprofitableness and shame of all their
restless traffic with other gods and alien empires. The
state is rotten;<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> anarchy prevails.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> The national
vitality is lessened: <i>Ephraim hath grey hairs</i>.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> Power
of birth and begetting have gone; the universal unchastity
causes the population to diminish: <i>their glory
flieth away like a bird</i>.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> The presents to Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> the
tribute to Assyria, drain the wealth of the people:
<i>strangers devour his strength</i>.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> The prodigal Israel
has his far-off country where he spends his substance
among strangers. It is in this connection that we
must take the repeated verse: <i>the pride of Israel testifieth
to his face</i>.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> We have seen<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> the impossibility of
the usual exegesis of these words, that by <i>the Pride of
Israel</i> Hosea means Jehovah; the word "pride" is probably
to be taken in the sense in which Amos employs
it of the exuberance and arrogance of Israel's civilisation.
If we are right, then Hosea describes a very subtle
symptom of the moral awakening whether of the individual
or of a community. The conscience of many
a man, of many a kingdom, has been reached only
through their pride. Pride is the last nerve which
comfort and habit leave quick; and when summons to
a man's better nature fail, it is still possible in most
cases to touch his pride with the presentation of the
facts of his decadence. This is probably what Hosea
means. Israel's prestige suffers. The civilisation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
which they are proud has its open wounds. Their
politicians are the sport of Egypt;<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> their wealth, the
very gold of their Temple, is lifted by Assyria.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> The
nerve of pride was also touched in the prodigal: "How
many hired servants of my father have enough and to
spare, while I perish with hunger." Yet, unlike him,
this prodigal son of God will not therefore return.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>
Though there are grey hairs upon him, though strangers
devour his strength, <i>he knoweth it not</i>; of him it cannot
be said that "he has come to himself." And that is
why the prophet threatens the further discipline of
actual exile from the land and its fruits,<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> of bitter
bread<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> and poverty<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> on an unclean soil. Israel must
also eat husks and feed with swine before he arises and
<i>returns to his God</i>.</p>

<p>But misery alone never led either man or nation
to repentance: the sorrow of this world worketh only
death. Repentance is the return to God; and it is
the awakening to the truth about God, to the facts
of His nature and His grace, which alone makes
repentance possible. No man's doctrine of repentance
is intelligible without his doctrine of God; and it
is because Hosea's doctrine of God is so rich, so
fair and so tender, that his doctrine of repentance
is so full and gracious. Here we see the difference
between him and Amos. Amos had also used the
phrase with frequency; again and again he had appealed
to the people to seek God and to return to God.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> But
from Amos it went forth only as a pursuing voice,
a voice crying in the wilderness. Hosea lets loose
behind it a heart, plies the people with gracious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
thoughts of God, and brings about them, not the voices
only, but the atmosphere, of love. <i>I will be as the dew
unto Israel</i>, promises the Most High; but He is before
His promise. The chapters of Hosea are drenched
with the dew of God's mercy, of which no drop falls on
those of Amos, but there God is rather the roar as
of a lion, the flash as of lightning. Both prophets
bid Israel turn to God; but Amos means by that,
to justice, truth and purity, while Hosea describes a
husband, a father, long-suffering and full of mercy.
"I bid you come back," cries Amos. But Hosea
pleads, "If only you were aware of what God is, you
would come back." "Come back to God and live,"
cries Amos; but Hosea, "Come back to God, for He
is Love." Amos calls, "Come back at once, for there
is but little time left till God must visit you in judgment";
but Hosea, "Come back at once, for God has
loved you so long and so kindly." Amos cries, "Turn,
for in front of you is destruction"; but Hosea, "Turn,
for behind you is God." And that is why all Hosea's
preaching of repentance is so evangelical. "I will
arise and go <i>to my Father</i>."</p>

<p>But the <i>third</i> element of the new knowledge which
means repentance is the conscience of guilt. <i>My
Father, I have sinned.</i> On this point it might be
averred that the teaching of Hosea is less spiritual than
that of later prophets in Israel, and that here at last
he comes short of the evangelical inwardness of the
New Testament. There is truth in the charge; and
here perhaps we feel most the defects of his standpoint,
as one who appeals, not to the individual, but to the
nation as a whole. Hosea's treatment of the sense
of guilt cannot be so spiritual as that, say, of the fifty-first
Psalm. But, at least, he is not satisfied to exhaust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
it by the very thorough exposure which he gives us
of the social sins of his day, and of their terrible
results. He, too, understands what is meant by a
conscience of sin. He has called Israel's iniquity
harlotry, unfaithfulness to God; and in a passage of
equal insight and beauty of expression he points out
that in the service of the Ba'alim Jehovah's people can
never feel anything but a harlot's shame and bitter
memories of the better past.</p>

<p><i>Rejoice not, O Israel, to the pitch of rapture like the
heathen: for thou hast played the harlot from thine own
God; 'tis hire thou hast loved on all threshing-floors.
Floor and vat shall not acknowledge them; the new wine
shall play them false.</i><a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> Mere children of nature may
abandon themselves to the riotous joy of harvest and
vintage festivals, for they have never known other gods
than are suitably worshipped by these orgies. But
Israel has a past&mdash;the memory of a holier God, the
conscience of having deserted Him for material gifts.
With such a conscience she can never enjoy the
latter; as Hosea puts it, they will not <i>acknowledge</i> or
<i>take to</i><a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> her. Here there is an instinct of the profound
truth, that even in the fulness of life conscience is
punishment; by itself the sense of guilt is judgment.</p>

<p>But Hosea does not attack the service of strange
gods only because it is unfaithfulness to Jehovah, but
also because, as the worship of images, it is a senseless
stupidity utterly inconsistent with that spiritual discernment
of which repentance so largely consists. And
with the worship of heathen idols Hosea equally condemns
the worship of Jehovah under the form of
images.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p>Hosea was the first in Israel to lead the attack upon
the idols. Elijah had assaulted the worship of a foreign
god, but neither he nor Elisha nor Amos condemned
the worship of Israel's own God under the form of a
calf. Indeed Amos, except in one doubtful passage,<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>
never at all attacks idols or false gods. The reason
is very obvious. Amos and Elijah were concerned
only with the proclamation of God as justice and
purity: and to the moral aspects of religion the
question of idolatry is not relevant; the two things do
not come directly into collision. But Hosea had
deeper and more wide views of God, with which
idolatry came into conflict at a hundred points. We
know what Hosea's <i>knowledge of God</i> was&mdash;how
spiritual, how extensive&mdash;and we can appreciate how
incongruous idolatry must have appeared against it.
We are prepared to find him treating the images,
whether of the Ba'alim or of Jehovah, with that fine
scorn which a passionate monotheism, justly conscious
of its intellectual superiority, has ever passed upon the
idolatry even of civilisations in other respects higher
than its own. To Hosea the idol is an <i>'eseb, a made
thing</i>.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> It is made of the very silver and gold with
which Jehovah Himself had endowed the people.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> It
is made only <i>to be cut off</i><a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> by the first invader! Chiefly,
however, does Hosea's scorn fall upon the image under
which Jehovah Himself was worshipped. <i>Thy Calf, O
Samaria!</i><a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> he contemptuously calls it. <i>From Israel is
it also</i>, as much as the Ba'alim. <i>A workman made it,
and no god is it: chips shall the Calf of Samaria become!</i>
In another place he mimics the <i>anxiety of Samaria for</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
<i>their Calf; his people mourn for him, and his priestlings
writhe for his glory</i>, why?&mdash;<i>because it is going into exile</i>:<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>
the gold that covers him shall be stripped for the tribute
to Assyria. And once more: <i>They continue to sin;
they make them a smelting of their silver, idols after their
own modelling, smith's work all of it. To these things
they speak! Sacrificing men</i> actually <i>kiss calves!</i><a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> All
this is in the same vein of satire which we find grown
to such brilliance in the great Prophet of the Exile.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>
Hosea was the first in whom it sparkled; and it was
due to his conception of <i>the knowledge of God</i>. Its
relevancy to his doctrine of repentance is this, that so
spiritual an apprehension of God as repentance implies,
so complete a <i>metanoia</i> or <i>change of mind</i>, is intellectually
incompatible with idolatry. You cannot speak of
repentance to men who <i>kiss calves</i> and worship blocks
of wood. Hence he says: <i>Ephraim is wedded to idols:
leave him alone</i>.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<p>There was more than idolatry, however, in the way
of Israel's repentance. The whole of the national
worship was an obstacle. Its formalism and its easy
and mechanical methods of <i>turning to God</i> disguised
the need of that moral discipline and change of heart,
without which no repentance can be genuine. Amos
had contrasted the ritualism of the time with the duty
of civic justice and the service of the poor:<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> Hosea
opposes to it leal love and the knowledge of God. <i>I
will have leal love and not sacrifice, and the knowledge
of God rather than burnt-offerings.</i><a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> It is characteristic
of Hosea to class sacrifices with idols. Both are
senseless and inarticulate, incapable of expressing or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
of answering the deep feelings of the heart. True
repentance, on the contrary, is rational, articulate,
definite. <i>Take with you words</i>, says Hosea, <i>and</i> so
<i>return to Jehovah</i>.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a></p>

<p>To us who, after twenty-five more centuries of talk,
know painfully how words may be abused, it is strange
to find them enforced as the tokens of sincerity. But
let us consider against what the prophet enforces them.
Against the <i>kissing of calves</i> and such mummery&mdash;worship
of images that neither hear nor speak.
Let us remember the inarticulateness of ritualism,
how it stifles rather than utters the feelings of the
heart. Let us imagine the dead routine of the legal
sacrifices, their original symbolism worn bare, bringing
forward to the young hearts of new generations no
interpretation of their ancient and distorted details,
reducing those who perform them to irrational machines
like themselves. Then let us remember how our own
Reformers had to grapple with the same hard mechanism
in the worship of their time, and how they bade the
heart of every worshipper <i>speak</i>&mdash;speak for itself to
God with rational and sincere words. So in place of
the frozen ritualism of the Church there broke forth from
all lands of the Reformation, as though it were birds in
springtime, a great burst of hymns and prayers, with
the clear notes of the Gospel in the common tongue.
So intolerable was the memory of what had been, that
it was even enacted that henceforth no sacrament
should be dispensed but the Word should be given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
the people along with it. If we keep all these things
in mind, we shall know what Hosea means when he
says to Israel in their penitence, <i>Take with you words</i>.</p>

<p>No one, however, was more conscious of the danger
of words. Upon the lips of the people Hosea has
placed a confession of repentance, which, so far as the
words go, could not be more musical or pathetic.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> In
every Christian language it has been paraphrased to
an exquisite confessional hymn. But Hosea describes
it as rejected. Its words are too easy; its thoughts
of God and of His power to save are too facile.
Repentance, it is true, starts from faith in the mercy
of God, for without this there were only despair.
Nevertheless in all true penitence there is despair.
Genuine sorrow for sin includes a feeling of the irreparableness
of the past, and the true penitent as he
casts himself upon God does not dare to feel that he
ever can be the same again. <i>I am no more worthy to
be called Thy son: make me as one of Thy hired servants.</i>
Such necessary thoughts as these Israel does not mingle
with her prayer. <i>Come and let us return to Jehovah,
for He hath torn</i> only <i>that He may heal, and smitten</i>
only <i>that He may bind up. He will revive us again in
a couple of days, on the third day raise us up, that we
may live before Him. Then shall we know if we hunt
up to know the Lord. As soon as we seek Him we shall
find Him: and He shall come upon us like winter-rain,
and like the spring-rain pouring on the land.</i> This is
too facile, too shallow. No wonder that God despairs
of such a people. <i>What am I to make of thee, Ephraim?</i><a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<p>Another familiar passage, the Parable of the Heifer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
describes the same ambition to reach spiritual results
without spiritual processes. <i>Ephraim is a broken-in
heifer&mdash;one that loveth to tread</i> out the corn. <i>But I will
pass upon her goodly neck. I will give Ephraim a yoke,
Judah must plough. Jacob must harrow for himself.</i><a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>
Cattle, being unmuzzled by law<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> at threshing time,
loved this best of all their year's work. Yet to reach
it they must first go through the harder and unrewarded
trials of ploughing and harrowing. Like a
heifer, then, which loved harvest only, Israel would
spring at the rewards of penitence, the peaceable fruits
of righteousness, without going through the discipline
and chastisement which alone yield them. Repentance
is no mere turning or even re-turning. It is a
deep and an ethical process&mdash;the breaking up of fallow
ground, the labour and long expectation of the sower,
the seeking and waiting for Jehovah till Himself send
the rain. <i>Sow to yourselves in righteousness; reap in
proportion to love</i> (the love you have sown), <i>break up
your fallow ground: for it is time to seek Jehovah, until
He come and rain righteousness upon us</i>.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<p>A repentance so thorough as this cannot but result
in the most clear and steadfast manner of life. Truly
it is a returning not by oneself, but <i>a returning by God</i>,
and it leads to the <i>keeping of leal love and justice, and
waiting upon God continually</i>.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE SIN AGAINST LOVE</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hosea</span> i.-iii.; iv. 11 ff.; ix. 10 ff.; xi. 8 f.</h5>


<p>The Love of God is a terrible thing&mdash;that is the
last lesson of the Book of Hosea. <i>My God will
cast them away.</i><a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<p><i>My God</i>&mdash;let us remember the right which Hosea
had to use these words. Of all prophets he was the
first to break into the full aspect of the Divine Mercy&mdash;to
learn and to proclaim that God is Love. But he
was worthy to do so, by the patient love of his own
heart towards another who for years had outraged all
his trust and tenderness. He had loved, believed and
been betrayed; pardoned and waited and yearned,
and sorrowed and pardoned again. It is in this
long-suffering that his breast beats upon the breast of
God with the cry <i>My God</i>. As he had loved Gomer, so
had God loved Israel, past hope, against hate, through
ages of ingratitude and apostasy. Quivering with his
own pain, Hosea has exhausted all human care and
affection for figures to express the Divine tenderness,
and he declares God's love to be deeper than all the
passion of men, and broader than all their patience:
<i>How can I give thee up, Ephraim? How can I let thee go,
Israel? I will not execute the fierceness of Mine anger.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
<i>For I am God, and not man.</i> And yet, like poor human
affection, this Love of God, too, confesses its failure&mdash;<i>My
God shall cast them away.</i> It is God's sentence
of relinquishment upon those who sin against His
Love, but the poor human lips which deliver it quiver
with an agony of their own, and here, as more explicitly
in twenty other passages of the book, declare it to be
equally the doom of those who outrage the love of their
fellow men and women.</p>

<p>We have heard it said: "The lives of men are never
the same after they have loved; if they are not better
they must be worse." "Be afraid of the love that
loves you: it is either your heaven or your hell."
"All the discipline of men springs from their love&mdash;if
they take it not so, then all their sorrow must spring
from the same source." "There is a depth of sorrow,
which can only be known to a soul that has loved the
most perfect thing and beholds itself fallen." These
things are true of the Love, both of our brother and of
our God. And the eternal interest of the life of Hosea
is that he learned how, for strength and weakness, for
better for worse, our human and our Divine loves are
inseparably joined.</p>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>Most men learn that love is inseparable from pain
where Hosea learned it&mdash;at home. There it is that
we are all reminded that when love is strongest she
feels her weakness most. For the anguish which love
must bear, as it were from the foundation of the world,
is the contradiction at her heart between the largeness
of her wishes and the littleness of her power to realise
them. A mother feels it, bending over the bed of her
child, when its body is racked with pain or its breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
spent with coughing. So great is the feeling of her
love that it ought to do something, that she will actually
feel herself cruel because nothing can be done. Let
the sick-bed become the beach of death, and she must
feel the helplessness and the anguish still more as
the dear life is now plucked from her and now tossed
back by the mocking waves, and then drawn slowly
out to sea upon the ebb from which there is no
returning.</p>

<p>But the pain which disease and death thus cause
to love is nothing to the agony that Sin inflicts when
he takes the game into his unclean hands. We know
what pain love brings, if our love be a fair face and fresh
body in which Death brands his sores while we stand
by, as if with arms bound. But what if our love be
a childlike heart, and a frank expression and honest
eyes, and a clean and clever mind. Our powerlessness
is just as great and infinitely more tormented when
Sin comes by and casts his shadow over these. Ah,
that is Love's greatest torment when her children, who
have run from her to the bosom of sin, look back and
their eyes are changed! That is the greatest torment
of Love&mdash;to pour herself without avail into one of
those careless natures which seem capacious and
receptive, yet never fill with love, for there is a crack
and a leak at the bottom of them. The fields where
Love suffers her sorest defeats are not the sick-bed and
not death's margin, not the cold lips and sealed eyes
kissed without response; but the changed eyes of
children, and the breaking of "the full-orbed face,"
and the darkening look of growing sons and daughters,
and the home the first time the unclean laugh breaks
across it. To watch, though unable to soothe, a dear
body racked with pain, is peace beside the awful vigil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
of watching a soul shrink and blacken with vice, and
your love unable to redeem it.</p>

<p>Such a clinical study Hosea endured for years. The
prophet of God, we are told, brought a dead child to
life by taking him in his arms and kissing him. But
Hosea with all his love could not make Gomer a true
whole wife again. Love had no power on this woman&mdash;no
power even at the merciful call to make all
things new. Hosea, who had once placed all hope in
tenderness, had to admit that Love's moral power is
not absolute. Love may retire defeated from the
highest issues of life. Sin may conquer Love.</p>

<p>Yet it is in this his triumph that Sin must feel the
ultimate revenge. When a man has conquered this
weak thing and beaten her down beneath his feet, God
speaks the sentence of abandonment.</p>

<p>There is enough of the whipped dog in all of us
to make us dread penalty when we come into conflict
with the strong things of life. But it takes us all our
days to learn that there is far more condemnation to
them who offend the weak things of life, and particularly
the weakest of all, its love. It was on sins against
the weak that Christ passed His sternest judgments:
<i>Woe unto him that offends one of these little ones; it were
better for him that he had never been born.</i> God's little
ones are not only little children, but all things which,
like little children, have only love for their strength.
They are pure and loving men and women&mdash;men
with no weapon but their love, women with no shield
but their trust. They are the innocent affections of
our own hearts&mdash;the memories of our childhood, the
ideals of our youth, the prayers of our parents, the
faith in us of our friends. These are the little ones of
whom Christ spake, that he who sins against them had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
better never have been born. Often may the dear solicitudes
of home, a father's counsels, a mother's prayers,
seem foolish things against the challenges of a world,
calling us to play the man and do as it does; often may
the vows and enthusiasms of boyhood seem impertinent
against the temptations which are so necessary to manhood:
yet let us be true to the weak, for if we betray
them, we betray our own souls. We may sin against
law and maim or mutilate ourselves, but to sin against
love is to be cast out of life altogether. He who
violates the purity of the love with which God has
filled his heart, he who abuses the love God has sent
to meet him in his opening manhood, he who slights
any of the affections, whether they be of man or
woman, of young or of old, which God lays upon us
as the most powerful redemptive forces of our life,
next to that of His dear Son&mdash;he sinneth against his
own soul, and it is of such that Hosea spake: <i>My God
will cast them away</i>.</p>

<p>We talk of breaking law: we can only break ourselves
against it. But if we sin against Love, we do
destroy her; we take from her the power to redeem and
sanctify us. Though in their youth men think Love a
quick and careless thing&mdash;a servant always at their side,
a winged messenger easy of despatch&mdash;let them know
that every time they send her on an evil errand she
returns with heavier feet and broken wings. When
they make her a pander they kill her outright. When
she is no more they waken to that which Gomer came
to know, that love abused is love lost, and love lost
means Hell.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>This, however, is only the margin from which Hosea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
beholds an abandonment still deeper. All that has
been said of human love and the penalty of outraging
it is equally true of the Divine love and the sin against
that.</p>

<p>The love of God has the same weakness which we
have seen in the love of man. It, too, may fail to
redeem; it, too, has stood defeated on some of the
highest moral battle-fields of life. God Himself has
suffered anguish and rejection from sinful men.
"Herein," says a theologian, "is the mystery of this
love, ... that God can never by His Almighty Power
compel that which is the very highest gift in the life
of His creatures&mdash;love to Himself, but that He receives
it as the free gift of His creatures, and that He is only
able to allow men to give it to Him in a free act of their
own will." So Hosea also has told us how God does
not compel, but allure or <i>woo</i>, the sinful back to Himself.
And it is the deepest anguish of the prophet's
heart, that this free grace of God may fail through man's
apathy or insincerity. The anguish appears in those
frequent antitheses in which his torn heart reflects
herself in the style of his discourse. <i>I have redeemed
them&mdash;yet have they spoken lies against Me.</i><a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> <i>I found
Israel like grapes in the wilderness&mdash;they went to Ba'al-Peor.</i><a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>
<i>When Israel was a child, then I loved him ...
but they sacrificed to Ba'alim.</i><a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> <i>I taught Ephraim to walk,
but they knew not that I healed them.</i><a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> <i>How can I give
thee up, Ephraim? how can I let thee go, O Israel?...
Ephraim compasseth Me with lies, and the house of Israel
with deceit!</i><a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>We fear to apply all that we know of the weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
of human love to the love of God. Yet though He be
God and not man, it was as man He commended His
love to us. He came nearest us, not in the thunders
of Sinai, but in Him Who presented Himself to the
world with the caresses of a little child; Who met men
with no angelic majesty or heavenly aureole, but whom
when we saw we found nothing that we should desire
Him, His visage was so marred more than any man,
and His form than the sons of men; Who came to His
own and His own received Him not; Who, having
loved His own that were in the world, loved them up
to the end, and yet at the end was by them deserted
and betrayed,&mdash;it is of Him that Hosea prophetically
says: <i>I drew them with cords of a man and with bands
of love</i>.</p>

<p>We are not bound to God by any unbreakable
chain. The strands which draw us upwards to God,
to holiness and everlasting life, have the weakness of
those which bind us to the earthly souls we love. It
is possible for us to break them. We love Christ, not
because He has compelled us by any magic, irresistible
influence to do so; but, as John in his great simplicity
says, <i>We love Him because He first loved us</i>.</p>

<p>Now this is surely the terror of God's love&mdash;that it
can be resisted; that even as it is manifest in Jesus
Christ we men have the power, not only to remain,
as so many do, outside its scope, feeling it to be far-off
and vague, but having tasted it to fall away from it,
having realised it to refuse it, having allowed it to
begin its moral purposes in our lives to baffle and
nullify these; to make the glory of Heaven absolutely
ineffectual in our own characters; and to give our
Saviour the anguish of rejection.</p>

<p>Give Him the anguish, yet pass upon ourselves the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
doom! For, as I read the New Testament, the one
unpardonable sin is the sin against our Blessed
Redeemer's Love as it is brought home to the heart
by the power of the Holy Spirit. Every other sin is
forgiven to men but to crucify afresh Him who loved
us and gave Himself for us. The most terrible of His
judgments is "the wail of a heart wounded because its
love has been despised": <i>Jerusalem, Jerusalem! how often
would I have gathered thy children as a hen gathereth her
chickens, and ye would not. Behold, your house is left
unto you desolate!</i></p>

<p>Men say they cannot believe in hell, because they
cannot conceive how God may sentence men to misery
for the breaking of laws they were born without power
to keep. And one would agree with the inference, if
God had done any such thing. But for them which
are under the law and the sentence of death, Christ
died once for all, that He might redeem them. Yet
this does not make a hell less believable. When we
see how Almighty was that Love of God in Christ
Jesus, lifting our whole race and sending them forward
with a freedom and a power of growth nothing else
in history has won for them; when we prove again
how weak it is, so that it is possible for millions of
characters that have felt it to refuse its eternal influence
for the sake of some base and transient
passion; nay, when <i>I myself</i> know this power and
this weakness of Christ's love, so that one day being
loyal I am raised beyond the reach of fear and of
doubt, beyond the desire of sin and the habit of evil,
and the next day finds me capable of putting it aside
in preference for some slight enjoyment or ambition&mdash;then
I know the peril and the terror of this love, that
it may be to a man either Heaven or Hell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>Believe then in hell, because you believe in the
Love of God&mdash;not in a hell to which God condemns
men of His will and pleasure, but a hell into which
men cast themselves from the very face of His love
in Jesus Christ. The place has been painted as a
place of fires. But when we contemplate that men
come to it with the holiest flames in their nature
quenched, we shall justly feel that it is rather a dreary
waste of ash and cinder, strewn with snow&mdash;some
ribbed and frosted Arctic zone, silent in death, for
there is no life there, and there is no life there because
there is no Love, and no Love because men in rejecting
or abusing her have slain their own power ever again
to feel her presence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE BOOK OF MICAH</i></h3>


<p>The Book of Micah lies sixth of the Twelve Prophets
in the Hebrew Canon, but in the order of the
Septuagint third, following Amos and Hosea. The
latter arrangement was doubtless directed by the size
of the respective books;<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> in the case of Micah it has
coincided with the prophet's proper chronological
position. Though his exact date be not certain, he
appears to have been a younger contemporary of Hosea,
as Hosea was of Amos.</p>

<p>The book is not two-thirds the size of that of Amos,
and about half that of Hosea. It has been arranged
in seven chapters, which follow, more or less, a natural
method of division.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> They are usually grouped in
three sections, distinguishable from each other by their
subject-matter, by their temper and standpoint, and to
a less degree by their literary form. They are
A. Chaps. i.-iii.; B. Chaps. iv., v.; C. Chaps, vi., vii.</p>

<p>There is no book of the Bible, as to the date of
whose different parts there has been more discussion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
especially within recent years. The history of this is
shortly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tradition and the criticism of the early years of this century
accepted the statement of the title, that the book was composed
in the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah&mdash;that is, between
740 and 700 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> It was generally agreed that there were in it
only traces of the first two reigns, but that the whole was put
together before the fall of Samaria in 721.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> Then Hitzig and
Steiner dated chaps, iii.-vi. after 721; and Ewald denied that
Micah could have given us chaps, vi., vii., and placed them under
King Manasseh, <i>circa</i> 690-640. Next Wellhausen<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> sought to
prove that vii. 7-20 must be post-exilic. Stade<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> took a further step,
and, on the ground that Micah himself could not have blunted or
annulled his sharp pronouncements of doom, by the promises
which chaps, iv. and v. contain, he withdrew these from the
prophet and assigned them to the time of the Exile.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> But the
sufficiency of this argument was denied by Vatke.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> Also in
opposition to Stade, Kuenen<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> refused to believe that Micah
could have been content with the announcement of the fall of
Jerusalem as his last word, that therefore much of chaps, iv. and
v. is probably from himself, but since their argument is obviously
broken and confused, we must look in them for interpolations,
and he decides that such are iv. 6-8, 11-13, and the working up
of v. 9-14. The famous passage in iv. 1-4 may have been
Micah's, but was probably added by another. Chaps, vi. and vii.
were written under Manasseh by some of the persecuted adherents
of Jehovah.</p>

<p>We may next notice two critics who adopt an extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
conservative position. Von Ryssel,<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> as the result of a very
thorough examination, declared that all the chapters were
Micah's, even the much doubted ii. 12, 13, which have been
placed by an editor of the book in the wrong position, and
chap. vii. 7-20, which he agrees with Ewald can only date from
the reign of Manasseh, Micah himself having lived long enough
into that reign to write them himself. Another careful analysis
by Elhorst<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> also reached the conclusion that the bulk of the
book was authentic, but for his proof of this Elhorst requires
a radical rearrangement of the verses, and that on grounds
which do not always commend themselves. He holds chap.
iv. 9-14 and v. 8 for post-exilic insertions. Driver<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> contributes
a thorough examination of the book, and reaches the conclusions
that ii. 12, 13, though obviously in their wrong place, need not
be denied to Micah; that the difficulties of ascribing chaps, iv., v.,
to the prophet are not insuperable, nor is it even necessary to
suppose in them interpolations. He agrees with Ewald as to
the date of vi.-vii. 6, and, while holding that it is quite possible
for Micah to have written them, thinks they are more probably
due to another, though a confident conclusion is not to be
achieved. As to vii. 7-20, he judges Wellhausen's inferences to
be unnecessary. A prophet in Micah's or Manasseh's time may
have thought destruction nearer than it actually proved to be,
and, imagining it as already arrived, have put into the mouth of
the people a confession suited to its circumstance. Wildeboer<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>
goes further than Driver. He replies in detail to the arguments
of Stade and Cornill, denies that the reasons for withdrawing so
much from Micah are conclusive, and assigns to the prophet the
whole book, with the exception of several interpolations.</p></blockquote>

<p>We see, then, that all critics are practically agreed
as to the presence of interpolations in the text, as well
as to the occurrence of certain verses of the prophet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
out of their proper order. This indeed must be obvious
to every careful reader as he notes the somewhat
frequent break in the logical sequence, especially of
chaps, iv. and v. All critics, too, admit the authenticity
of chaps, i.-iii., with the possible exception of ii. 12, 13;
while a majority hold that chaps, vi. and vii., whether
by Micah or not, must be assigned to the reign of
Manasseh. On the authenticity of chaps, iv. and v.&mdash;<i>minus</i>
interpolations&mdash;and of chaps, vi. and vii., opinion
is divided; but we ought not to overlook the remarkable
fact that those who have recently written the
fullest monographs on Micah<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> incline to believe in the
genuineness of the book as a whole.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> We may now
enter for ourselves upon the discussion of the various
sections, but before we do so let us note how much
of the controversy turns upon the general question,
whether after decisively predicting the overthrow of
Jerusalem it was possible for Micah to add prophecies
of her restoration. It will be remembered that we
have had to discuss this same point with regard both
to Amos and Hosea. In the case of the former we
decided against the authenticity of visions of a blessed
future which now close his book; in the case of the
latter we decided for the authenticity. What were our
reasons for this difference? They were, that the closing
vision of the Book of Amos is not at all in harmony
with the exclusively ethical spirit of the authentic
prophecies; while the closing vision of the Book of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Hosea is not only in language and in ethical temper
thoroughly in harmony with the chapters which precede
it, but in certain details has been actually anticipated
by these. Hosea, therefore, furnishes us with the
case of a prophet who, though he predicted the ruin of
his impenitent people (and that ruin was verified by
events), also spoke of the possibility of their restoration
upon conditions in harmony with his reasons for the
inevitableness of their fall. And we saw, too, that the
hopeful visions of the future, though placed last in
the collection of his prophecies, need not necessarily
have been spoken last by the prophet, but stand
where they do because they have an eternal spiritual
validity for the remnant of Israel.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> What was possible
for Hosea is surely possible for Micah. That
promises come in his book, and closely after the
conclusive threats which he gave of the fall of Jerusalem,
does not imply that originally he uttered them
all in such close proximity. That indeed would have
been impossible. But considering how often the
political prospect in Israel changed during Micah's
time, and how far the city was in his day from her
actual destruction&mdash;more than a century distant&mdash;it
seems to be improbable that he should not (in whatever
order) have uttered both threat and promise. And
naturally, when his prophecies were arranged in permanent
order, the promises would be placed after the
threats.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">First Section: Chaps. I.-III.</span></h4>

<p>No critic doubts the authenticity of the bulk of these
chapters. The sole question at issue is the date or
(possibly) the dates of them. Only chap. ii. 12, 13,
are generally regarded as out of place, where they
now stand.</p>

<p>Chap. i. trembles with the destruction of both
Northern Israel and Judah&mdash;a destruction either very
imminent or actually in the process of happening. The
verses which deal with Samaria, 6 ff., do not simply
announce her inevitable ruin. They throb with the
sense either that this is immediate, or that it is going
on, or that it has just been accomplished. The verbs
suit each of these alternatives: <i>And I shall set</i>, or <i>am
selling</i>, or <i>have set</i>, <i>Samaria for a ruin of the field</i>, and
so on. We may assign them to any time between
725 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the beginning of the siege of Samaria by
Shalmaneser, and a year or two after its destruction by
Sargon in 721. Their intense feeling seems to preclude
the possibility of their having been written in the years
to which some assign them, 705-700, or twenty years
after Samaria was actually overthrown.</p>

<p>In the next verses the prophet goes on to mourn the
fact that the affliction of Samaria reaches even to the
gate of Jerusalem, and he especially singles out as partakers
in the danger of Jerusalem a number of towns,
most of which (so far as we can discern) lie not between
Jerusalem and Samaria, but at the other corner of
Judah, in the Shephelah or out upon the Philistine plain.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>
This was the region which Sennacherib invaded in 701,
simultaneously with his detachment of a corps to attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
the capital; and accordingly we might be shut up to
affirm that this end of chap. i. dates from that invasion,
if no other explanation of the place-names were possible.
But another is possible. Micah himself belonged
to one of these Shephelah towns, Moresheth-Gath,
and it is natural that, anticipating the invasion of all
Judah, after the fall of Samaria (as Isaiah<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> also did),
he should single out for mourning his own district of
the country. This appears to be the most probable
solution of a very doubtful problem, and accordingly
we may date the whole of chap. i. somewhere between
725 and 720 or 718. Let us remember that in 719
Sargon marched past this very district of the Shephelah
in his campaign against Egypt, whom he defeated at
Raphia.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></p>

<p>Our conclusion is supported by chap. ii. Judah,
though Jehovah be planning evil against her, is in the
full course of her ordinary social activities. The rich
are absorbing the lands of the poor (vv. i. ff.): note
the phrase <i>upon their beds</i>; it alone signifies a time
of security. The enemies of Israel are internal (8).
The public peace is broken by the lords of the land
and men and women, disposed to live quietly, are
robbed (8 ff.). The false prophets have sufficient signs
of the times in their favour to regard Micah's threats of
destruction as calumnies (6). And although he regards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
destruction as inevitable, it is not to be to-day; but <i>in
that day</i> (4), viz. some still indefinite date in the future,
the blow will fall and the nation's elegy be sung.
On this chapter, then, there is no shadow of a
foreign invader. We might assign it to the years of
Jotham and Ahaz (under whose reigns the title of the
book places part of the prophesying of Micah), but
since there is no sense of a double kingdom, no
distinction between Judah and Israel, it belongs more
probably to the years when all immediate danger from
Assyria had passed away, between Sargon's withdrawal
from Raphia in 719 and his invasion of Ashdod in
710, or between the latter date and Sennacherib's
accession in 705.</p>

<p>Chap. iii. contains three separate oracles, which
exhibit a similar state of affairs: the abuse of the
common people by their chiefs and rulers, who are
implied to be in full sense of power and security. They
have time to aggravate their doings (4); their doom is
still future&mdash;<i>then at that time</i> (<i>ib.</i>). The bulk of the
prophets determine their oracles by the amount men
give them (5), another sign of security. Their doom
is also future (6 f.). In the third of the oracles the
authorities of the land are in the undisturbed exercise of
their judicial offices (9 f.), and the priests and prophets
of their oracles (10), though all these professions practise
only for bribe and reward. Jerusalem is still being built
and embellished (10). But the prophet, not because
there are political omens pointing to this, but simply
in the force of his indignation at the sins of the upper
classes, prophesies the destruction of the capital (12).
It is possible that these oracles of chap. iii. may be
later than those of the previous chapters.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Second Section: Chaps. IV., V.</span></h4>

<p>This section of the book opens with two passages,
verses 1-5 and verses 6, 7, which there are serious
objections against assigning to Micah.</p>

<p>1. The first of these, 1-5, is the famous prophecy of
the Mountain of the Lord's House, which is repeated in
Isaiah ii. 2-5. Probably the Book of Micah presents
this to us in the more original form.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> The alternatives
therefore are four: Micah was the author, and Isaiah
borrowed from him; or both borrowed from an earlier
source;<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> or the oracle is authentic in Micah, and has
been inserted by a later editor in Isaiah; or it has been
inserted by later editors in both Micah and Isaiah.</p>

<p>The last of these conclusions is required by the
arguments first stated by Stade and Hackmann, and
then elaborated, in a very strong piece of reasoning, by
Cheyne. Hackmann, after marking the want of connection
with the previous chapter, alleges the keynotes
of the passage to be three: that it is not the arbitration
of Jehovah,<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> but His sovereignty over foreign
nations, and their adoption of His law, which the
passage predicts; that it is the Temple at Jerusalem
whose future supremacy is affirmed; and that there is
a strong feeling against war. These, Cheyne contends,
are the doctrines of a much later age than that of
Micah; he holds the passage to be the work of a
post-exilic imitator of the prophets, which was first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
intruded into the Book of Micah and afterwards borrowed
from this by an editor of Isaiah's prophecies.
It is just here, however, that the theory of these critics
loses its strength. Agreeing heartily as I do with recent
critics that the genuine writings of the early prophets
have received some, and perhaps considerable, additions
from the Exile and later periods, it seems to me extremely
improbable that the same post-exilic insertion
should find its way into <i>two</i> separate books. And I
think that the undoubted bias towards the post-exilic
period of all Canon Cheyne's recent criticism, has in
this case hurried him past due consideration of the
possibility of a pre-exilic date. In fact the gentle
temper shown by the passage towards foreign nations,
the absence of hatred or of any ambition to subject the
Gentiles to servitude to Israel, contrasts strongly with
the temper of many exilic and post-exilic prophecies;<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>
while the position which it demands for Jehovah and
His religion is quite consistent with the fundamental
principles of earlier prophecy. The passage really
claims no more than a suzerainty of Jehovah over the
heathen tribes, with the result only that their war
with Israel and with one another shall cease, not
that they shall become, as the great prophecy of the
Exile demands, tributaries and servitors. Such a claim
was no more than the natural deduction from the early
prophets' belief of Jehovah's supremacy in righteousness.
And although Amos had not driven the principle
so far as to promise the absolute cessation of war, he
also had recognised in the most unmistakable fashion
the responsibility of the Gentiles to Jehovah, and His
supreme arbitrament upon them.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> And Isaiah himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
in his prophecy on Tyre, promised a still more
complete subjection of the life of the heathen to the
service of Jehovah.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> Moreover the fifth verse of the
passage in Micah (though it is true its connection
with the previous four is not apparent) is much more
in harmony with pre-exilic than with post-exilic
prophecy: <i>All the nations shall walk each in the name
of his god, and we shall walk in the name of Jehovah our
God for ever and aye</i>. This is consistent with more
than one prophetic utterance before the Exile,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> but it
is not consistent with the beliefs of Judaism after the
Exile. Finally, the great triumph achieved for Jerusalem
in 701 is quite sufficient to have prompted the
feelings expressed by this passage for the <i>mountain of
the house of the Lord</i>; though if we are to bring it
down to a date subsequent to 701, we must rearrange
our views with regard to the date and meaning of the
second chapter of Isaiah. In Micah the passage is
obviously devoid of all connection, not only with the
previous chapter, but with the subsequent verses of
chap. iv. The possibility of a date in the eighth or
beginning of the seventh century is all that we can
determine with regard to it; the other questions must
remain in obscurity.</p>

<p>2. Verses 6, 7, may refer to the Captivity of Northern
Israel, the prophet adding that when it shall be restored
the united kingdom shall be governed from
Mount Zion; but a date during the Exile is, of course,
equally probable.</p>

<p>3. Verses 8-13 contain a series of small pictures of
Jerusalem in siege, from which, however, she issues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
triumphant.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> It is impossible to say whether such a
siege is actually in course while the prophet writes, or
is pictured by him as inevitable in the near future.
The words <i>thou shalt go to Babylon</i> may be, but are not
necessarily, a gloss.</p>

<p>4. Chap. iv. 14-v. 8 again pictures such a siege of
Jerusalem, but promises a Deliverer out of Bethlehem,
the city of David.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> Sufficient heroes will be raised up
along with him to drive the Assyrians from the land,
and what is left of Israel after all these disasters shall
prove a powerful and sovereign influence upon the
peoples. These verses were probably not all uttered
at the same time.</p>

<p>5. Verses 9-14.&mdash;In prospect of such a deliverance
the prophet returns to what chap. i. has already
described and Isaiah frequently emphasises as the sin
of Judah&mdash;her armaments and fortresses, her magic and
idolatries, the things she trusted in instead of Jehovah.
They will no more be necessary, and will disappear.
The nations that serve not Jehovah will feel His wrath.</p>

<p>In all these oracles there is nothing inconsistent
with authorship in the eighth century: there is much
that witnesses to this date. Everything that they
threaten or promise is threatened or promised by
Hosea and by Isaiah, with the exception of the destruction
(in ver. 12) of the Maççeboth, or sacred pillars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
against which we find no sentence going forth from
Jehovah before the Book of Deuteronomy, while Isaiah
distinctly promises the erection of a Maççebah to
Jehovah in the land of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> But waiving for the
present the possibility of a date for Deuteronomy, or for
part of it, in the reign of Hezekiah, we must remember
the destruction, which took place under this king, of
idolatrous sanctuaries in Judah, and feel also that, in
spite of such a reform, it was quite possible for Isaiah
to introduce a Maççebah into his poetic vision of the
worship of Jehovah in Egypt. For has he not also
dared to say that the <i>harlot's hire</i> of the Ph&#339;nician
commerce shall one day be consecrated to Jehovah?</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Third Section: Chaps. VI., VII.</span></h4>

<p>The style now changes. We have had hitherto a
series of short oracles, as if delivered orally. These
are succeeded by a series of conferences or arguments,
by several speakers. Ewald accounts for the change
by supposing that the latter date from a time of persecution,
when the prophet, unable to speak in public,
uttered himself in literature. But chap. i. is also
dramatic.</p>

<p>1. Chap. vi. 1-8.&mdash;An argument in which the prophet
as herald calls on the hills to listen to Jehovah's case
against the people (1, 2). Jehovah Himself appeals to
the latter, and in a style similar to Hosea's cites His
deeds in their history, as evidence of what He seeks
from them (3-5). The people, presumably penitent, ask
how they shall come before Jehovah (6, 7). And the
prophet tells them what Jehovah has declared in the
matter (8). Opening very much like Micah's first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
oracle (chap. i. 1), this argument contains nothing
strange either to Micah or the eighth century. Exception
has been taken to the reference in ver. 7 to the
sacrifice of the first-born, which appears to have
become more common from the gloomy age of Manasseh
onwards, and which, therefore, led Ewald to date all
chaps. vi. and vii. from that king's reign. But child-sacrifice
is stated simply as a possibility, and&mdash;occurring
as it does at the climax of the sentence&mdash;as an extreme
possibility.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> I see no necessity, therefore, to deny the
piece to Micah or the reign of Hezekiah. Of those
who place it under Manasseh, some, like Driver, still
reserve it to Micah himself, whom they suppose to
have survived Hezekiah and seen the evil days which
followed.</p>

<p>2. Verses 9-16.&mdash;Most expositors<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> take these verses
along with the previous eight, as well as with the six
which follow in chap. vii. But there is no connection
between verses 8 and 9; and 9-16 are better taken by
themselves. The prophet heralds, as before, the speech
of Jehovah to <i>tribe and city</i>(9). Addressing Jerusalem,
Jehovah asks how He can forgive such fraud and
violence as those by which her wealth has been gathered
(10-12). Then addressing the people (note the change
from feminine to masculine in the second personal pronouns)
He tells them He must smite; they shall not
enjoy the fruit of their labours(14, 15). They have
sinned the sins of Omri and the house of Ahab (query&mdash;should
it not be of Ahab and the house of Omri?), so
that they must be put to shame before the Gentiles<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a>(16).
In this section three or four words have been marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
as of late Hebrew.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> But this is uncertain, and the inference
made from it precarious. The deeds of Omri and
Ahab's house have been understood as the persecution
of the adherents of Jehovah, and the passage has,
therefore, been assigned by Ewald and others to the
reign of the tyrant Manasseh. But such habits of
persecution could hardly be imputed to the City or
People as a whole; and we may conclude that the
passage means some other of that notorious dynasty's
sins. Among these, as is well known, it is possible to
make a large selection&mdash;the favouring of idolatry, or
the tyrannous absorption by the rich of the land of
the poor (as in Naboth's case), a sin which Micah has
already marked as that of his age. The whole treatment
of the subject, too, whether under the head of the
sin or its punishment, strongly resembles the style and
temper of Amos. It is, therefore, by no means impossible
for this passage also to have been Micah's, and
we must accordingly leave the question of its date
undecided. Certainly we are not shut up, as the
majority of modern critics suppose, to a date under
Manasseh or Amon.</p>

<p>3. Chap. vii. 1-6.&mdash;These verses are spoken by the
prophet in his own name or that of the people's. The
land is devastated; the righteous have disappeared;
everybody is in ambush to commit deeds of violence
and take his neighbour unawares. There is no justice:
the great ones of the land are free to do what they
like; they have intrigued with and bribed the authorities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
Informers have crept in everywhere. Men
must be silent, for the members of their own families
are their foes. Some of these sins have already been
marked by Micah as those of his age (chap. ii.), but
the others point rather to a time of persecution such
as that under Manasseh. Wellhausen remarks the
similarity to the state of affairs described in Mal. iii. 24
and in some Psalms. We cannot fix the date.</p>

<p>4. Verses 7-20.&mdash;This passage starts from a totally
different temper of prophecy, and presumably, therefore,
from very different circumstances. Israel, as a whole,
speaks in penitence. She has sinned, and bows herself
to the consequences, but in hope. A day shall come
when her exiles shall return and the heathen acknowledge
her God. The passage, and with it the Book of
Micah, concludes by apostrophising Jehovah as the
God of forgiveness and grace to His people. Ewald,
and following him Driver, assign the passage, with
those which precede it, to the times of Manasseh, in
which of course it is possible that Micah was still
active, though Ewald supposes a younger and anonymous
prophet as the author. Wellhausen<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> goes further,
and, while recognising that the situation and temper of
the passage resemble those of Isaiah xl. ff., is inclined
to bring it even further down to post-exilic times,
because of the universal character of the Diaspora.
Driver objects to these inferences, and maintains that
a prophet in the time of Manasseh, thinking the destruction
of Jerusalem to be nearer than it actually was, may
easily have pictured it as having taken place, and put
an ideal confession in the mouth of the people. It
seems to me that all these critics have failed to appreciate
a piece of evidence even more remarkable than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
any they have insisted on in their argument for a late
date. This is, that the passage speaks of a restoration
of the people only to Bashan and Gilead, the provinces
overrun by Tiglath-Pileser III. in 734. It is
not possible to explain such a limitation either by the
circumstances of Manasseh's time or by those of the
Exile. In the former surely Samaria would have been
included; in the latter Zion and Judah would have
been emphasised before any other region. It would
be easy for the defenders of a post-exilic date, and
especially of a date much subsequent to the Exile,
to account for a longing after Bashan and Gilead,
though they also would have to meet the objection
that Samaria or Ephraim is not mentioned. But how
natural it would be for a prophet writing soon after
the captivity of Tiglath-Pileser III. to make this precise
selection! And although there remain difficulties
(arising from the temper and language of the passage)
in the way of assigning all of it to Micah or his contemporaries,
I feel that on the geographical allusions
much can be said for the origin of this part of the
passage in their age, or even in an age still earlier: that
of the Syrian wars in the end of the ninth century, with
which there is nothing inconsistent either in the spirit
or the language of vv. 14-17. And I am sure that if
the defenders of a late date had found a selection of
districts as suitable to the post-exilic circumstances
of Israel as the selection of Bashan and Gilead is to
the circumstances of the eighth century, they would,
instead of ignoring it, have emphasised it as a conclusive
confirmation of their theory. On the other
hand, ver. 11 can date only from the Exile, or the following
years, before Jerusalem was rebuilt. Again,
vv. 18-20 appear to stand by themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems likely, therefore, that chap. vii. 7-20 is a
Psalm composed of little pieces from various dates,
which, combined, give us a picture of the secular sorrows
of Israel, and of the conscience she ultimately felt
in them, and conclude by a doxology to the everlasting
mercies of her God.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

<h3><i>MICAH THE MORASTHITE</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Micah</span> i.</h5>


<p>Some time in the reign of Hezekiah, when the
kingdom of Judah was still inviolate, but shivering
to the shock of the fall of Samaria, and probably while
Sargon the destroyer was pushing his way past Judah
to meet Egypt at Raphia, a Judæan prophet of the
name of Micah, standing in sight of the Assyrian march,
attacked the sins of his people and prophesied their
speedy overthrow beneath the same flood of war. If
we be correct in our surmise, the exact year was
720-719 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Amos had been silent thirty years,
Hosea hardly fifteen; Isaiah was in the midway of
his career. The title of Micah's book asserts that he
had previously prophesied under Jotham and Ahaz,
and though we have seen it to be possible, it is by no
means proved, that certain passages of the book date
from these reigns.</p>

<p>Micah is called the Morasthite.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> For this designation
there appears to be no other meaning than that of a
native of Moresheth-Gath, a village mentioned by himself.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>
It signifies <i>Property</i> or <i>Territory</i> of Gath, and
after the fall of the latter, which from this time no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
more appears in history, Moresheth may have been
used alone. Compare the analogous cases of Helkath
(<i>portion of</i>&mdash;) Galilee, Ataroth, Chesulloth and Iim.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></p>

<p>In our ignorance of Gath's position, we should be
equally at fault about Moresheth, for the name has
vanished, were it not for one or two plausible pieces
of evidence. Belonging to Gath, Moresheth must have
lain near the Philistine border: the towns among
which Micah includes it are situate in that region;
and Jerome declares that the name&mdash;though the form,
Morasthi, in which he cites it is suspicious&mdash;was in his
time still extant in a small village to the east of Eleutheropolis
or Beit-Jibrin. Jerome cites Morasthi as
distinct from the neighbouring Mareshah, which is also
quoted by Micah beside Moresheth-Gath.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

<p>Moresheth was, therefore, a place in the Shephelah,
or range of low hills which lie between the hill-country
of Judah and the Philistine plain. It is the opposite
exposure from the wilderness of Tekoa,<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> some seventeen
miles away across the watershed. As the home
of Amos is bare and desert, so the home of Micah
is fair and fertile. The irregular chalk hills are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
separated by broad glens, in which the soil is alluvial
and red, with room for cornfields on either side of
the perennial or almost perennial streams. The olive
groves on the braes are finer than either those of
the plain below or of the Judæan tableland above.
There is herbage for cattle. Bees murmur everywhere,
larks are singing, and although to-day you
may wander in the maze of hills for hours without
meeting a man or seeing a house, you are never out
of sight of the traces of ancient habitation, and seldom
beyond sound of the human voice&mdash;shepherds and
ploughmen calling to their flocks and to each other
across the glens. There are none of the conditions or
of the occasions of a large town. But, like the south
of England, the country is one of villages and homesteads,
breeding good yeomen&mdash;men satisfied and in
love with their soil, yet borderers with a far outlook
and a keen vigilance and sensibility. The Shephelah
is sufficiently detached from the capital and body of the
land to beget in her sons an independence of mind and
feeling, but so much upon the edge of the open world
as to endue them at the same time with that sense
of the responsibilities of warfare, which the national
statesmen, aloof and at ease in Zion, could not possibly
have shared.</p>

<p>Upon one of the westmost terraces of this Shephelah,
nearly a thousand feet above the sea, lay Moresheth
itself. There is a great view across the undulating
plain with its towns and fortresses, Lachish, Eglon,
Shaphir and others, beyond which runs the coast road,
the famous war-path between Asia and Africa. Ashdod
and Gaza are hardly discernible against the glitter of
the sea, twenty-two miles away. Behind roll the round
bush-covered hills of the Shephelah, with David's hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
at Adullam,<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> the field where he fought Goliath, and
many another scene of border warfare; while over
them rises the high wall of the Judæan plateau,
with the defiles breaking through it to Hebron and
Bethlehem.</p>

<p>The valley-mouth near which Moresheth stands has
always formed the south-western gateway of Judæa,
the Philistine or Egyptian gate, as it might be called,
with its outpost at Lachish, twelve miles across the
plain. Roads converge upon this valley-mouth from
all points of the compass. Beit-Jibrin, which lies in it,
is midway between Jerusalem and Gaza, about twenty-five
miles from either, nineteen miles from Bethlehem
and thirteen from Hebron. Visit the place at any
point of the long history of Palestine, and you find it
either full of passengers or a centre of campaign.
Asa defeated the Ethiopians here. The Maccabees
and John Hyrcanus contested Mareshah, two miles
off, with the Idumeans. Gabinius fortified Mareshah.
Vespasian and Saladin both deemed the occupation of
the valley necessary before they marched upon Jerusalem.
Septimius Severus made Beit-Jibrin the capital
of the Shephelah, and laid out military roads, whose
pavements still radiate from it in all directions. The
<i>Onomasticon</i> measures distances in the Shephelah from
Beit-Jibrin. Most of the early pilgrims from Jerusalem
by Gaza to Sinai or Egypt passed through it, and it was
a centre of Crusading operations whether against Egypt
during the Latin kingdom or against Jerusalem during
the Third Crusade. Not different was the place in the
time of Micah. Micah must have seen pass by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
door the frequent embassies which Isaiah tells us went
down to Egypt from Hezekiah's court, and seen return
those Egyptian subsidies in which a foolish people put
their trust instead of in their God.</p>

<p>In touch, then, with the capital, feeling every throb
of its folly and its panic, but standing on that border
which must, as he believed, bear the brunt of the invasion
that its crimes were attracting, Micah lifted
up his voice. They were days of great excitement.
The words of Amos and Hosea had been fulfilled upon
Northern Israel. Should Judah escape, whose injustice
and impurity were as flagrant as her sister's?
It were vain to think so. The Assyrians had come up
to her northern border. Isaiah was expecting their
assault upon Mount Zion.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> The Lord's Controversy
was not closed. Micah will summon the whole earth
to hear the old indictment and the still unexhausted
sentence.</p>

<span class="i0"><i>Yea, it hath come unto Judah!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>It hath smitten right up to the gate of my people,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Up to Jerusalem.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Within the capital itself Isaiah was also recording
the extension of the Assyrian invasion to its walls,
but in a different temper.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> He was full of the exulting
assurance that, although at the very gate, the Assyrian
could not harm the city of Jehovah, but must fall when
he lifted his impious hand against it. Micah has no
such hope: he is overwhelmed with the thought of
Jerusalem's danger. Provincial though he be, and full
of wrath at the danger into which the politicians of
Jerusalem had dragged the whole country, he profoundly
mourns the peril of the capital, <i>the gate of my
people</i>, as he fondly calls her. Therefore we must
not exaggerate the frequently drawn contrast between
Isaiah and himself.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> To Micah also Jerusalem was
dear, and his subsequent prediction of her overthrow<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>
ought to be read with the accent of this previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
mourning for her peril. Nevertheless his heart clings
most to his own home, and while Isaiah pictures the
Assyrian entering Judah from the north by Migron,
Michmash and Nob, Micah anticipates invasion by the
opposite gateway of the land, at the door of his own
village. His elegy sweeps across the landscape so
dear to him. This obscure province was even more
than Jerusalem his world, the world of his heart.
It gives us a living interest in the man that the fate
of these small villages, many of them vanished, should
excite in him more passion than the fortunes of Zion
herself. In such a passion we can incarnate his spirit.
Micah is no longer a book, or an oration, but flesh
and blood upon a home and a countryside of his own.
We see him on his housetop pouring forth his words
before the hills and the far-stretching heathen land.
In the name of every village within sight he reads
a symbol of the curse that is coming upon his
country, and of the sins that have earned the curse.
So some of the greatest poets have caught their music
from the nameless brooklets of their boyhood's fields;
and many a prophet has learned to read the tragedy
of man and God's verdict upon sin in his experience
of village life. But there was more than feeling in
Micah's choice of his own country as the scene of the
Assyrian invasion. He had better reasons for his
fears than Isaiah, who imagined the approach of the
Assyrian from the north. For it is remarkable how
invaders of Judæa, from Sennacherib to Vespasian and
from Vespasian to Saladin and Richard, have shunned
the northern access to Jerusalem and endeavoured to
reach her by the very gateway at which Micah stood
mourning. He had, too, this greater motive for his
fear, that Sargon, as we have seen, was actually in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
the neighbourhood, marching to the defeat of Judah's
chosen patron, Egypt. Was it not probable that, when
the latter was overthrown, Sargon would turn back
upon Judah by Lachish and Mareshah? If we keep this
in mind we shall appreciate, not only the fond anxiety,
but the political foresight that inspires the following
passage, which is to our Western taste so strangely
cast in a series of plays upon place-names. The disappearance
of many of these names, and our ignorance
of the transactions to which the verses allude, often
render both the text and the meaning very uncertain.
Micah begins with the well-known play upon the name
of Gath; the Acco which he couples with it is either
the Ph&#339;nician port to the north of Carmel, the modern
Acre, or some Philistine town, unknown to us, but
in any case the line forms with the previous one an
intelligible couplet: <i>Tell it not in Tell-town; Weep
not in Weep-town</i>. The following Beth-le-'Aphrah,
<i>House of Dust</i>, must be taken with them, for in the
phrase <i>roll thyself</i> there is a play upon the name
Philistine. So, too, Shaphir, or Beauty, the modern
Suafîr, lay in the Philistine region. Sa'anan and
Beth-esel and Maroth are unknown; but if Micah, as
is probable, begins his list far away on the western
horizon and comes gradually inland, they also are to
be sought for on the maritime plain. Then he draws
nearer by Lachish, on the first hills, and in the leading
pass towards Judah, to Moresheth-Gath, Achzib,
Mareshah and Adullam, which all lie within Israel's
territory and about the prophet's own home. We
understand the allusion, at least, to Lachish in ver. 13.
As the last Judæan outpost towards Egypt, and on a
main road thither, Lachish would receive the Egyptian
subsidies of horses and chariots, in which the politicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
put their trust instead of in Jehovah. Therefore
she <i>was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion</i>.
And if we can trust the text of ver. 14, Lachish would
pass on the Egyptian ambassadors to Moresheth-Gath,
the next stage of their approach to Jerusalem. But
this is uncertain. With Moresheth-Gath is coupled
Achzib, a town at some distance from Jerome's site for
the former, to the neighbourhood of which, Mareshah,
we are brought back again in ver. 15. Adullam, with
which the list closes, lies some eight or ten miles to
the north-east of Mareshah.</p>

<p>This was the terrible fate which the Assyrian kept
before the peoples with whom he was at war. Other
foes raided, burned and slew: he carried off whole
populations into exile.</p>

<p>Having thus pictured the doom which threatened
his people, Micah turns to declare the sins for which
it has been sent upon them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE PROPHET OF THE POOR</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Micah</span> ii., iii.</h5>


<p>We have proved Micah's love for his countryside in
the effusion of his heart upon her villages with
a grief for their danger greater than his grief for Jerusalem.
Now in his treatment of the sins which give that
danger its fatal significance, he is inspired by the same
partiality for the fields and the folk about him. While
Isaiah chiefly satirises the fashions of the town and
the intrigues of the court, Micah scourges the avarice
of the landowner and the injustice which oppresses the
peasant. He could not, of course, help sharing Isaiah's
indignation for the fatal politics of the capital, any
more than Isaiah could help sharing his sense of the
economic dangers of the provinces;<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> but it is the latter
with which Micah is most familiar and on which he
spends his wrath. These so engross him, indeed, that
he says almost nothing about the idolatry, or the
luxury, or the hideous vice, which, according to Amos
and Hosea, were now corrupting the nation.</p>

<p>Social wrongs are always felt most acutely, not in
the town, but in the country. It was so in the days
of Rome, whose earliest social revolts were agrarian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>
It was so in the Middle Ages: the fourteenth century
saw both the Jacquerie in France and the Peasants'
Rising in England; Langland, who was equally familiar
with town and country, expends nearly all his sympathy
upon the poverty of the latter, "the poure folk in cotes."
It was so after the Reformation, under the new spirit
of which the first social revolt was the Peasants' War
in Germany. It was so at the French Revolution,
which began with the march of the starving peasants
into Paris. And it is so still, for our new era of social
legislation has been forced open, not by the poor of
London and the large cities, but by the peasantry of
Ireland and the crofters of the Scottish Highlands.
Political discontent and religious heresy take their
start among industrial and manufacturing centres, but
the first springs of the social revolt are nearly always
found among rural populations.</p>

<p>Why the country should begin to feel the acuteness
of social wrong before the town is sufficiently obvious.
In the town there are mitigations, and there are escapes.
If the conditions of one trade become oppressive, it is
easier to pass to another. The workers are better
educated and better organised; there is a middle class,
and the tyrant dare not bring matters to so high a
crisis. The might of the wealthy, too, is divided; the
poor man's employer is seldom at the same time his
landlord. But in the country power easily gathers into
the hands of the few. The labourer's opportunities and
means of work, his home, his very standing-ground, are
often all of them the property of one man. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
country the rich have a real power of life and death,
and are less hampered by competition with each other
and by the force of public opinion. One man cannot
hold a city in fee, but one man can affect for evil or for
good almost as large a population as a city's, when
it is scattered across a countryside.</p>

<p>This is precisely the state of wrong which Micah
attacks. The social changes of the eighth century in
Israel were peculiarly favourable to its growth.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> The
enormous increase of money which had been produced
by the trade of Uzziah's reign threatened to overwhelm
the simple economy under which every family
had its croft. As in many another land and period,
the social problem was the descent of wealthy men,
land-hungry, upon the rural districts. They made the
poor their debtors, and bought out the peasant proprietors.
They absorbed into their power numbers of
homes, and had at their individual disposal the lives
and the happiness of thousands of their fellow-countrymen.
Isaiah had cried, <i>Woe upon them that join house
to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room</i> for the
common people, and the inhabitants of the rural districts
grow fewer and fewer.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> Micah pictures the recklessness
of those plutocrats&mdash;the fatal ease with which their
wealth enabled them to dispossess the yeomen of
Judah.</p>

<p>The prophet speaks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Woe to them that plan mischief,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And on their beds work out evil!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As soon as morning breaks they put it into execution,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For&mdash;it lies to the power of their hands!</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>They covet fields and&mdash;seize them,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Houses and&mdash;lift them up.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>So they crush a good man and his home,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A man and his heritage.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is the evil&mdash;the ease with which wrong is done
in the country! <i>It lies to the power of their hands:
they covet and seize.</i> And what is it that they get so
easily&mdash;not merely field and house, so much land and
stone and lime: it is human life, with all that makes
up personal independence, and the security of home
and of the family. That these should be at the mercy
of the passion or the caprice of one man&mdash;this is what
stirs the prophet's indignation. We shall presently
see how the tyranny of wealth was aided by the
bribed and unjust judges of the country; and how,
growing reckless, the rich betook themselves, as the
lords of the feudal system in Europe continually did,
to the basest of assaults upon the persons of peaceful
men and women. But meantime Micah feels that by
themselves the economic wrongs explain and justify the
doom impending on the nation. When this doom falls,
by the Divine irony of God it shall take the form of a
conquest of the land by the heathen, and the disposal
of these great estates to the foreigner.</p>

<p>The prophet speaks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Therefore thus saith Jehovah:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Behold, I am planning evil against this race,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>From which ye shall not withdraw your necks,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nor walk upright;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For an evil time it is!</i><a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In that day shall they raise a taunt-song against you,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And wail out the wailing</i> ("<i>It is done</i>");<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> <i>and say,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>"We be utterly undone:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My people's estate is measured off!</i><a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>How they take it away from me!</i><a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To the rebel our fields are allotted."</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>So thou shalt have none to cast the line by lot</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In the congregation of Jehovah.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No restoration at time of Jubilee for lands taken away
in this fashion! There will be no congregation of
Jehovah left!</p>

<p>At this point the prophet's pessimist discourse, that
must have galled the rich, is interrupted by their
clamour to him to stop.</p>

<p>The rich speak:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Prate not, they prate, let none prate of such things!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Revilings will never cease!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>O thou that speakest</i> thus <i>to the house of Jacob,</i><a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Is the spirit of Jehovah cut short?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or are such His doings?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Shall not His words mean well with him that walketh uprightly?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So the rich, in their immoral confidence that Jehovah
was neither weakened nor could permit such a disaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
to fall on His own people, tell the prophet that his
sentence of doom on the nation, and especially on themselves,
is absurd, impossible. They cry the eternal cry
of Respectability: "God can mean no harm to the
like of us! His words are good to them that walk
uprightly&mdash;and we are conscious of being such. What
you, prophet, have charged us with are nothing but
natural transactions." The Lord Himself has His
answer ready. Upright indeed! They have been
unprovoked plunderers!</p>

<p>God speaks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>But ye are the foes of My people,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Rising against those that are peaceful;</i><br /></span>

<p>Of the outrages on the goods of honest men, and the
persons of women and children, which are possible in
a time of peace, when the rich are tyrannous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
abetted by mercenary judges and prophets, we have
an illustration analogous to Micah's in the complaint
of Peace in Langland's vision of English society in the
fourteenth century. The parallel to our prophet's words
is very striking:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>They pride themselves that all is stable and God is
with them. How can such a state of affairs be stable!
They feel at ease, yet injustice can never mean rest.
God has spoken the final sentence, but with a rare
sarcasm the prophet adds his comment on the scene.
These rich men had been flattered into their religious
security by hireling prophets, who had opposed himself.
As they leave the presence of God, having heard their
sentence, Micah looks after them and muses in quiet
prose.</p>

<p>The prophet speaks:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Yea, if one whose walk is wind and falsehood were to try
to cozen</i> thee, saying, <i>I will babble to thee of wine and
strong drink, then he might be the prophet of such a people.</i></p>

<p>At this point in chap. ii. there have somehow slipped
into the text two verses (12, 13), which all are agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
do not belong to it, and for which we must find another
place.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> They speak of a return from the Exile, and
interrupt the connection between ver. 11 and the first
verse of chap. iii. With the latter Micah begins a series
of three oracles, which give the substance of his own
prophesying in contrast to that of the false prophets
whom he has just been satirising. He has told us
what they say, and he now begins the first of his own
oracles with the words, <i>But I said</i>. It is an attack upon
the authorities of the nation, whom the false prophets
flatter. Micah speaks very plainly to them. Their
business is to know justice, and yet they love wrong.
They flay the people with their exactions; they cut up
the people like meat.</p>

<p>
The prophet speaks:&mdash;<i>But I said,</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Hear now, O chiefs Of Jacob,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>And rulers of the house of Israel:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Is it not yours to know justice?&mdash;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Haters of good and lovers of evil,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Tearing their hide from upon them</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">(he points to the people),</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>And their flesh from the bones of them;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>And who devour the flesh of my people,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>And their hide they have stripped from them</i></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>And their bones have they cleft,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>And served it up as if from a pot,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Like meat from the thick of the caldron!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>At that time shall they cry to Jehovah,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>And He will not answer them;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>But hide His face from them at that time,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Because they have aggravated their deeds.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>These words of Micah are terribly strong, but there
have been many other ages and civilisations than his
own of which they have been no more than true.
"They crop us," said a French peasant of the lords
of the great Louis' time, "as the sheep crops grass."
"They treat us like their food," said another on the
eve of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Is there nothing of the same with ourselves? While
Micah spoke he had wasted lives and bent backs before
him. His speech is elliptic till you see his finger
pointing at them. Pinched peasant-faces peer between
all his words and fill the ellipses. And among the
living poor to-day are there not starved and bitten
faces&mdash;bodies with the blood sucked from them, with
the Divine image crushed out of them? Brothers, we
cannot explain all of these by vice. Drunkenness and
unthrift do account for much; but how much more
is explicable only by the following facts! Many men
among us are able to live in fashionable streets and
keep their families comfortable only by paying their
employés a wage upon which it is impossible for men
to be strong or women to be virtuous. Are those not
using these as their food? They tell us that if they
are to give higher wages they must close their business,
and cease paying wages at all; and they are
right if they themselves continue to live on the scale
they do. As long as many families are maintained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
comfort by the profits of businesses in which some or
all of the employés work for less than they can nourish
and repair their bodies upon, the simple fact is that the
one set are feeding upon the other set. It may be
inevitable, it may be the fault of the system and not of
the individual, it may be that to break up the system
would mean to make things worse than ever&mdash;but
all the same the truth is clear that many families
of the middle class, and some of the very wealthiest
of the land, are nourished by the waste of the lives of
the poor. Now and again the fact is acknowledged
with as much shamelessness as was shown by any tyrant
in the days of Micah. To a large employer of labour,
who was complaining that his employés, by refusing
to live at the low scale of Belgian workmen, were
driving trade from this country, the present writer
once said: "Would it not meet your wishes if, instead
of your workmen being levelled down, the Belgians
were levelled up? This would make the competition
fair between you and the employers in Belgium." His
answer was, "I care not so long as I get my profits."
He was a religious man, a liberal giver to his Church,
and he died leaving more than one hundred thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>Micah's tyrants, too, had religion to support them.
A number of the hireling prophets, whom we have
seen both Amos and Hosea attack, gave their blessing
to this social system, which crushed the poor, for they
shared its profits. They lived upon the alms of the
rich, and flattered according as they were fed. To them
Micah devotes the second oracle of chap. iii., and we
find confirmed by his words the principle we laid down
before, that in that age the one great difference between
the false and the true prophet was what it has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
in every age since then till now&mdash;an ethical difference;
and not a difference of dogma, or tradition, or ecclesiastical
note. The false prophet spoke, consciously or
unconsciously, for himself and his living. He sided
with the rich; he shut his eyes to the social condition
of the people; he did not attack the sins of the day.
This made him <i>false</i>&mdash;robbed him of insight and the
power of prediction. But the true prophet exposed
the sins of his people. Ethical insight and courage,
burning indignation of wrong, clear vision of the facts
of the day&mdash;this was what Jehovah's spirit put into
him, this was what Micah felt to be inspiration.</p>

<p>The prophet speaks:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>Thus saith Jehovah against the prophets who lead my people astray,</i><br />
<i>Who while they have ought between their teeth proclaim peace.</i><br />
<i>But against him who will not lay to their mouths they sanctify war!</i><br />
<i>Wherefore night shall be yours without vision,</i><br />
<i>And yours shall be darkness without divination;</i><br />
<i>And the sun shall go down on the prophets,</i><br />
<i>And the day shall darken about them;</i><br />
<i>And the seers shall be put to the blush,</i><br />
<i>And the diviners be ashamed:</i><br />
<i>All of them shall cover the beard,</i><br />
<i>For there shall be no answer from God.</i><br />
<i>But I&mdash;I am full of power by the spirit of Jehovah, and justice and might,</i><br />
<i>To declare to Jacob his transgressions and to Israel his sin.</i><br />
</p>

<p>In the third oracle of this chapter rulers and
prophets are combined&mdash;how close the conspiracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
between them! It is remarkable that, in harmony
with Isaiah, Micah speaks no word against the king.
But evidently Hezekiah had not power to restrain the
nobles and the rich. When this oracle was uttered it
was a time of peace, and the lavish building, which
we have seen to be so marked a characteristic of
Israel in the eighth century,<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> was in process. Jerusalem
was larger and finer than ever. Ah, it was a
building of God's own city <i>in blood</i>! Judges, priests and
prophets were all alike mercenary, and the poor were
oppressed for a reward. No walls, however sacred,
could stand on such foundations. Did they say that
they built her so grandly, for Jehovah's sake? Did
they believe her to be inviolate because He was in
her? They should see. Zion&mdash;yes, Zion&mdash;should be
ploughed like a field, and the Mountain of the Lord's
Temple become desolate.</p>

<p>The prophet speaks:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>Hear now this, O chiefs of the house of Jacob,</i><br />
<i>And rulers of the house of Israel,</i><br />
<i>Who spurn justice and twist all that is straight,</i><br />
<i>Building Zion in blood, and Jerusalem with crime!</i><br />
<i>Her chiefs give judgment for a bribe,</i><br />
<i>And her priests oracles for a reward,</i><br />
<i>And her prophets divine for silver;</i><br />
<i>And on Jehovah they lean, saying:</i><br />
"<i>Is not Jehovah in the midst of us?</i><br />
<i>Evil cannot come at us.</i>"<br />
<i>Therefore for your sakes shall Zion be ploughed like a field,</i><br />
<i>And Jerusalem become heaps,</i><br />
<i>And the Mount of the House mounds in a jungle.</i><br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>
<p>It is extremely difficult for us to place ourselves in
a state of society in which bribery is prevalent, and
the fingers both of justice and of religion are gilded by
their suitors. But this corruption has always been
common in the East. "An Oriental state can never
altogether prevent the abuse by which officials, small
and great, enrich themselves in illicit ways."<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> The
strongest government takes the bribery for granted,
and periodically prunes the rank fortunes of its great
officials. A weak government lets them alone. But
in either case the poor suffer from unjust taxation
and from laggard or perverted justice. Bribery has
always been found, even in the more primitive and
puritan forms of Semitic life. Mr. Doughty has borne
testimony with regard to this among the austere
Wahabees of Central Arabia. "When I asked if
there were no handling of bribes at Hâyil by those who
are nigh the prince's ear, it was answered, 'Nay.' The
Byzantine corruption cannot enter into the eternal and
noble simplicity of this people's (airy) life, in the poor
nomad country; but (we have seen) the art is not
unknown to the subtle-headed Shammar princes, who
thereby help themselves with the neighbour Turkish
governments."<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> The bribes of the ruler of Hâyil "are,
according to the shifting weather of the world, to great
Ottoman government men; and now on account of
Kheybar, he was gilding some of their crooked fingers
in Medina."<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> Nothing marks the difference of Western
government more than the absence of all this, especially
from our courts of justice. Yet the improvement has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
only come about within comparatively recent centuries.
What a large space, for instance, does Langland give
to the arraigning of "Mede," the corrupter of all
authorities and influences in the society of his day!
Let us quote his words, for again they provide a most
exact parallel to Micah's, and may enable us to realise
a state of life so contrary to our own. It is Conscience
who arraigns Mede before the King:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

<h3><i>ON TIME'S HORIZON</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Micah</span> iv. 1-7.</h5>


<p>The immediate prospect of Zion's desolation which
closes chap. iii. is followed in the opening of
chap. iv. by an ideal picture of her exaltation and
supremacy <i>in the issue of the days</i>. We can hardly
doubt that this arrangement has been made of purpose,
nor can we deny that it is natural and artistic.
Whether it be due to Micah himself, or whether
he wrote the second passage, are questions we have
already discussed.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> Like so many others of their
kind, they cannot be answered with certainty, far less
with dogmatism. But I repeat, I see no conclusive
reason for denying either to the circumstances of
Micah's times or to the principles of their prophecy
the possibility of such a hope as inspires chap. iv. 1-4.
Remember how the prophets of the eighth century
identified Jehovah with supreme and universal righteousness;
remember how Amos explicitly condemned
the aggravations of war and slavery among the
heathen as sins against Him, and how Isaiah claimed
the future gains of Tyrian commerce as gifts for His
sanctuary; remember how Amos heard His voice come
forth from Jerusalem, and Isaiah counted upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
eternal inviolateness of His shrine and city,&mdash;and you
will not think it impossible for a third Judæan prophet
of that age, whether he was Micah or another, to
have drawn the prospect of Jerusalem which now
opens before us.</p>

<p>It is the far-off horizon of time, which, like the
spatial horizon, always seems a fixed and eternal
line, but as constantly shifts with the shifting of our
standpoint or elevation. Every prophet has his own
vision of <i>the latter days</i>; seldom is that prospect the same.
Determined by the circumstances of the seer, by the
desires these prompt or only partially fulfil, it changes
from age to age. The ideal is always shaped by the
real, and in this vision of the eighth century there
is no exception. This is not any of the ideals of later
ages, when the evil was the oppression of the Lord's
people by foreign armies or their scattering in exile;
it is not, in contrast to these, the spectacle of the
armies of the Lord of Hosts imbrued in the blood of
the heathen, or of the columns of returning captives
filling all the narrow roads to Jerusalem, <i>like streams
in the south</i>; nor, again, is it a nation of priests
gathering about a rebuilt temple and a restored ritual.
But because the pain of the greatest minds of the
eighth century was the contradiction between faith in
the God of Zion as Universal Righteousness and the
experience that, nevertheless, Zion had absolutely no
influence upon surrounding nations, this vision shows
a day when Zion's influence will be as great as her
right, and from far and wide the nations whom Amos
has condemned for their transgressions against Jehovah
will acknowledge His law, and be drawn to Jerusalem
to learn of Him. Observe that nothing is said of
Israel going forth to teach the nations the law of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
Lord. That is the ideal of a later age, when Jews
were scattered across the world. Here, in conformity
with the experience of a still untravelled people, we
see the Gentiles drawing in upon the Mountain of the
House of the Lord. With the same lofty impartiality
which distinguishes the oracles of Amos on the heathen,
the prophet takes no account of their enmity to Israel;
nor is there any talk&mdash;such as later generations were
almost forced by the hostility of neighbouring tribes
to indulge in&mdash;of politically subduing them to the king
in Zion. Jehovah will arbitrate between them, and
the result shall be the institution of a great peace,
with no special political privilege to Israel, unless this
be understood in ver. 5, which speaks of such security
to life as was impossible, at that time at least, in all
borderlands of Israel. But among the heathen themselves
there will be a resting from war: the factions
and ferocities of that wild Semitic world, which Amos
so vividly characterised,<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> shall cease. In all this there
is nothing beyond the possibility of suggestion by the
circumstances of the eighth century or by the spirit of
its prophecy.</p>

<p>A prophet speaks:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span><i>And it shall come to pass in the issue of the days,</i><a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a><br />
<i>That the Mount of the House of Jehovah shall be established on the tops</i><a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> <i>of the mountains,</i><br />
<i>And lifted shall it be above the hills,</i><br />
<i>And peoples shall flow to it,</i><br />
<i>And many nations shall go and say:</i><br />
"<i>Come, and let us up to the Mount of Jehovah,</i><br />
<i>And to the House of the God of Jacob,</i><br />
<i>That He may teach us of His ways,</i><br />
<i>And we will walk in His paths.</i>"<br />
<i>For from Zion goeth forth the law,</i><br />
<i>And the word of Jehovah from out of Jerusalem!</i><br />
<i>And He shall judge between many peoples,</i><br />
<i>And decide</i><a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> <i>for strong nations far and wide;</i><a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a><br />
<i>And they shall hammer their swords into ploughshares,</i><br />
<i>And their spears into pruning-hooks:</i><br />
<i>They shall not lift up, nation against nation, a sword,</i><br />
<i>And they shall not any more learn war.</i><br />
<i>Every man shall dwell under his vine</i><br />
<i>And under his fig-tree,</i><br />
<i>And none shall make afraid;</i><br />
<i>For the mouth of Jehovah of Hosts has spoken.</i><br />
</p>

<p>What connection this last verse is intended to have
with the preceding is not quite obvious. It may mean
that every family among the Gentiles shall dwell in
peace; or, as suggested above, that with the voluntary
disarming of the surrounding heathendom, Israel
herself shall dwell secure, in no fear of border raids and
slave-hunting expeditions, with which especially Micah's
Shephelah and other borderlands were familiar. The
verse does not occur in Isaiah's quotation of the three
which precede it. We can scarcely suppose, fain though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
we may be to do so, that Micah added the verse in order
to exhibit the future correction of the evils he has been
deploring in chap. iii.: the insecurity of the householder
in Israel before the unscrupulous land-grabbing of the
wealthy. Such are not the evils from which this
passage prophesies redemption. It deals only, like the
first oracles of Amos, with the relentlessness and
ferocity of the heathen: under Jehovah's arbitrament
these shall be at peace, and whether among themselves
or in Israel, hitherto so exposed to their raids, men
shall dwell in unalarmed possession of their houses and
fields. Security from war, not from social tyranny, is
what is promised.</p>

<p>The following verse (5) gives in a curious way the
contrast of the present to that future in which all men
will own the sway of one God. <i>For</i> at the present
time <i>all the nations are walking each in the name of his
God, but we go in the name of Jehovah for ever and aye</i>.</p>

<p>To which vision, complete in itself, there has been
added by another hand, of what date we cannot tell,
a further effect of God's blessed influence. To peace
among men shall be added healing and redemption, the
ingathering of the outcast and the care of the crippled.</p>

<p>
<i>In that day&mdash;'tis the oracle of Jehovah&mdash;I will gather the halt,</i><br />
<i>And the cast-off I will bring in, and all that I have afflicted;</i><br />
<i>And I will make the halt for a Remnant,</i><a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a><br />
<i>And her that was weakened</i><a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> <i>into a strong people,</i><br />
<i>And Jehovah shall reign over them</i><br />
<i>In the Mount of Zion from now and for ever.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever be the origin of the separate oracles which
compose this passage (iv. 1-7), they form as they now
stand a beautiful whole, rising from Peace through
Freedom to Love. They begin with obedience to God
and they culminate in the most glorious service which
God or man may undertake, the service of saving the
lost. See how the Divine spiral ascends. We have,
first, Religion the centre and origin of all, compelling
the attention of men by its historical evidence of justice
and righteousness. We have the world's willingness
to learn of it. We have the results in the widening
brotherhood of nations, in universal Peace, in Labour
freed from War, and with none of her resources absorbed
by the conscriptions and armaments which in our times
are deemed necessary for enforcing peace. We have
the universal diffusion and security of Property, the
prosperity and safety of the humblest home. And,
finally, we have this free strength and wealth inspired
by the example of God Himself to nourish the broken
and to gather in the forwandered.</p>

<p>Such is the ideal world, seen and promised two
thousand five hundred years ago, out of as real an
experience of human sin and failure as ever mankind
awoke to. Are we nearer the Vision to-day, or does
it still hang upon time's horizon, that line which seems
so stable from every seer's point of view, but which
moves from the generations as fast as they travel to it?</p>

<p>So far from this being so, there is much in the
Vision that is not only nearer us than it was to the
Hebrew prophets, and not only abreast of us, but
actually achieved and behind us, as we live and strive
still onward. Yes, brothers, actually behind us!
History has in part fulfilled the promised influence of
religion upon the nations. The Unity of God has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
owned, and the civilised peoples bow to the standards
of justice and of mercy first revealed from Mount
Zion. <i>Many nations</i> and <i>powerful nations</i> acknowledge
the arbitrament of the God of the Bible. We have
had revealed that High Fatherhood of which every
family in heaven and earth is named; and wherever
that is believed the brotherhood of men is confessed.
We have seen Sin, that profound discord in man and
estrangement from God, of which all human hatreds
and malices are the fruit, atoned for and reconciled by
a Sacrifice in face of which human pride and passion
stand abashed. The first part of the Vision is fulfilled.
<i>The nations stream to the God of Jerusalem and His
Christ.</i> And though to-day our Peace be but a paradox,
and the "Christian" nations stand still from war not
in love, but in fear of one another, there are in every
nation an increasing number of men and women, with
growing influence, who, without being fanatics for peace,
or blind to the fact that war may be a people's duty
in fulfilment of its own destiny or in relief of the
enslaved, do yet keep themselves from foolish forms of
patriotism, and by their recognition of each other across
all national differences make sudden and unconsidered
war more and more of an impossibility. I write this
in the sound of that call to stand upon arms which
broke like thunder upon our Christmas peace; but,
amid all the ignoble jealousies and hot rashness which
prevail, how the air, burned clean by that first electric
discharge, has filled with the determination that war
shall not happen in the interests of mere wealth or
at the caprice of a tyrant! God help us to use this
peace for the last ideals of His prophet! May we
see, not that of which our modern peace has been far
too full, mere freedom for the wealth of the few to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
increase at the expense of the mass of mankind. May
our Peace mean the gradual disarmament of the nations,
the increase of labour, the diffusion of property, and,
above all, the redemption of the waste of the people
and the recovery of our outcasts. Without this, peace
is no peace; and better were war to burn out by its
fierce fires those evil humours of our secure comfort,
which render us insensible to the needy and the fallen
at our side. Without the redemptive forces at work
which Christ brought to earth, peace is no peace; and
the cruelties of war, that slay and mutilate so many,
are as nothing to the cruelties of a peace which leaves
us insensible to the outcasts and the perishing, of
whom there are so many even in our civilisation.</p>

<p>One application of the prophecy may be made at this
moment. We are told by those who know best and
have most responsibility in the matter that an ancient
Church and people of Christ are being left a prey to
the wrath of an infidel tyrant, not because Christendom
is without strength to compel him to deliver,
but because to use the strength, would be to imperil
the peace, of Christendom. It is an ignoble peace
which cannot use the forces of redemption, and with
the cry of Armenia in our ears the Unity of Europe is
but a mockery.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE KING TO COME</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Micah</span> iv. 8-v</h5>


<p>When a people has to be purged of long
injustice, when some high aim of liberty or
of order has to be won, it is remarkable how often
the drama of revolution passes through three acts.
There is first the period of criticism and of vision,
in which men feel discontent, dream of new things,
and put their hopes into systems: it seems then as
if the future were to come of itself. But often a
catastrophe, relevant or irrelevant, ensues: the visions
pale before a vast conflagration, and poet, philosopher
and prophet disappear under the feet of a mad mob
of wreckers. Yet this is often the greatest period of
all, for somewhere in the midst of it a strong character
is forming, and men, by the very anarchy, are being
taught, in preparation for him, the indispensableness
of obedience and loyalty. With their chastened minds
he achieves the third act, and fulfils all of the early
vision that God's ordeal by fire has proved worthy to
survive. Thus history, when distraught, rallies again
upon the Man.</p>

<p>To this law the prophets of Israel only gradually
gave expression. We find no trace of it among the
earliest of them; and in the essential faith of all there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
was much which predisposed them against the conviction
of its necessity. For, on the one hand, the seers
were so filled with the inherent truth and inevitableness
of their visions, that they described these as if already
realised; there was no room for a great figure to rise
before the future, for with a rush the future was upon
them. On the other hand, it was ever a principle of
prophecy that God is able to dispense with human aid.
"In presence of the Divine omnipotence all secondary
causes, all interposition on the part of the creature,
fall away."<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> The more striking is it that before long
the prophets should have begun, not only to look for
a Man, but to paint him as the central figure of their
hopes. In Hosea, who has no such promise, we already
see the instinct at work. The age of revolution which
he describes is cursed by its want of men: there is
no great leader of the people sent from God; those
who come to the front are the creatures of faction and
party; there is no king from God.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> How different
it had been in the great days of old, when God had
ever worked for Israel through some man&mdash;a Moses,
a Gideon, a Samuel, but especially a David. Thus
memory equally with the present dearth of personalities
prompted to a great desire, and with passion Israel
waited for a Man. The hope of the mother for her
firstborn, the pride of the father in his son, the eagerness
of the woman for her lover, the devotion of the
slave to his liberator, the enthusiasm of soldiers for
their captain&mdash;unite these noblest affections of the
human heart and you shall yet fail to reach the passion
and the glory with which prophecy looked for the
King to Come. Each age, of course, expected him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
the qualities of power and character needed for its
own troubles, and the ideal changed from glory unto
glory. From valour and victory in war, it became
peace and good government, care for the poor and
the oppressed, sympathy with the sufferings of the
whole people, but especially of the righteous among
them, with fidelity to the truth delivered unto the fathers,
and, finally, a conscience for the people's sin, a bearing
of their punishment and a travail for their spiritual redemption.
But all these qualities and functions were
gathered upon an individual&mdash;a Victor, a King, a
Prophet, a Martyr, a Servant of the Lord.</p>

<p>Micah stands among the first, if he is not the very
first, who thus focussed the hopes of Israel upon a
great Redeemer; and his promise of Him shares all
the characteristics just described. In his book it lies
next a number of brief oracles with which we are
unable to trace its immediate connection. They differ
from it in style and rhythm: they are in verse, while
it seems to be in prose. They do not appear to have
been uttered along with it. But they reflect the
troubles out of which the Hero is expected to emerge,
and the deliverance which He shall accomplish, though
at first they picture the latter without any hint of
Himself. They apparently describe an invasion which
is actually in course, rather than one which is near
and inevitable; and if so they can only date from
Sennacherib's campaign against Judah in 701 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
Jerusalem is in siege, standing alone in the land,<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> like
one of those solitary towers with folds round them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
which were built here and there upon the border
pastures of Israel for defence of the flock against the
raiders of the desert.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> The prophet sees the possibility
of Zion's capitulation, but the people shall leave
her only for their deliverance elsewhere. Many are
gathered against her, but he sees them as sheaves
upon the floor for Zion to thresh. This oracle (vv.
11-13) cannot, of course, have been uttered at the same
time as the previous one, but there is no reason why
the same prophet should not have uttered both at
different periods. Isaiah had prospects of the fate of
Jerusalem which differ quite as much.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> Once more
(ver. 14) the blockade is established. Israel's ruler
is helpless, <i>smitten on the cheek by the foe</i>.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> It is to
this last picture that the promise of the Deliverer is
attached.</p>

<p>The prophet speaks:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>But thou, O Tower of the Flock,</i><br />
<i>Hill of the daughter of Zion,</i><br />
<i>To thee shall arrive the former rule,</i><br />
<i>And the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Zion.</i><br />

"<i>Let her be violate, that our eyes may fasten on Zion!</i>"<br />

</p>

<p>Bethlehem was the birthplace of David, but when
Micah says that the Deliverer shall emerge from her
he does not only mean what Isaiah affirms by his
promise of a rod from the stock of Jesse, that the King
to Come shall spring from the one great dynasty in
Judah. Micah means rather to emphasise the rustic
and popular origin of the Messiah, <i>too small to be among
the thousands of Judah</i>. David, the son of Jesse the
Bethlehemite, was a dearer figure than Solomon son
of David the King. He impressed the people's imagination,
because he had sprung from themselves, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
his lifetime had been the popular rival of an unlovable
despot. Micah himself was the prophet of the country
as distinct from the capital, of the peasants as against
the rich who oppressed them. When, therefore, he
fixed upon Bethlehem as the Messiah's birthplace, he
doubtless desired, without departing from the orthodox
hope in the Davidic dynasty, to throw round its new
representative those associations which had so endeared
to the people their father-monarch. The shepherds
of Judah, that strong source of undefiled life from
which the fortunes of the state and prophecy itself had
ever been recuperated, should again send forth salvation.
Had not Micah already declared that, after the overthrow
of the capital and the rulers, the glory of Israel
should come to Adullam, where of old David had
gathered its soiled and scattered fragments?</p>

<p>We may conceive how such a promise would affect
the crushed peasants for whom Micah wrote. A
Saviour, who was one of themselves, not born up there
in the capital, foster-brother of the very nobles who
oppressed them, but born among the people, sharer
of their toils and of their wrongs!&mdash;it would bring
hope to every broken heart among the disinherited poor
of Israel. Yet meantime, be it observed, this was a
promise, not for the peasants only, but for the whole
people. In the present danger of the nation the class
disputes are forgotten, and the hopes of Israel gather
upon their Hero for a common deliverance from the
foreign foe. <i>Such an One shall be our peace.</i> But in
the peace He is <i>to stand and shepherd His flock</i>, conspicuous
and watchful. The country-folk knew what such
a figure meant to themselves for security and weal on
the land of their fathers. Heretofore their rulers had
not been shepherds, but thieves and robbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>We can imagine the contrast which such a vision
must have offered to the fancies of the false prophets.
What were they beside this? Deity descending in
fire and thunder, with all the other features of the
ancient Theophanies that had now become so much
cant in the mouths of mercenary traditionalists. Besides
those, how sane was this, how footed upon the
earth, how practical, how popular in the best sense!</p>

<p>We see, then, the value of Micah's prophecy for his
own day. Has it also any value for ours&mdash;especially
in that aspect of it which must have appealed to the
hearts of those for whom chiefly Micah arose? "Is it
wise to paint the Messiah, to paint Christ, so much as
a working-man? Is it not much more to our purpose
to remember the general fact of His humanity, by which
He is able to be Priest and Brother to all classes, high
and low, rich and poor, the noble and the peasant alike?
Is not the Man of Sorrows a much wider name than
the Man of Labour?" Let us answer these questions.</p>

<p>The value of such a prophecy of Christ lies in the
correctives which it supplies to the Christian apocalypse
and theology. Both of these have raised Christ to
a throne too far above the actual circumstance of His
earthly ministry and the theatre of His eternal sympathies.
Whether enthroned in the praises of heaven,
or by scholasticism relegated to an ideal and abstract
humanity, Christ is lifted away from touch with the
common people. But His lowly origin was a fact.
He sprang from the most democratic of peoples. His
ancestor was a shepherd, and His mother a peasant
girl. He Himself was a carpenter: at home, as His
parables show, in the fields and the folds and the
barns of His country; with the servants of the great
houses, with the unemployed in the market; with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
woman in the hovel seeking one piece of silver, with
the shepherd on the moors seeking the lost sheep.
<i>The poor had the gospel preached to them; and the
common people heard Him gladly.</i> As the peasants
of Judæa must have listened to Micah's promise of His
origin among themselves with new hope and patience,
so in the Roman empire the religion of Jesus Christ
was welcomed chiefly, as the Apostles and the Fathers
bear witness, by the lowly and the labouring of every
nation. In the great persecution which bears his name,
the Emperor Domitian heard that there were two
relatives alive of this Jesus whom so many acknowledged
as their King, and he sent for them that he
might put them to death. But when they came, he
asked them to hold up their hands, and seeing these
brown and chapped with toil, he dismissed the men,
saying, "From such slaves we have nothing to fear."
Ah but, Emperor! it is just the horny hands of this
religion that thou and thy gods have to fear! Any
cynic or satirist of thy literature from Celsus onwards
could have told thee that it was by men who worked
with their hands for their daily bread, by domestics,
artisans and all manner of slaves, that the power of
this King should spread, which meant destruction to
thee and thine empire! <i>From little Bethlehem came forth
the Ruler</i>, and <i>now He is great to the ends of the earth</i>.</p>

<p>There follows upon this prophecy of the Shepherd
a curious fragment which divides His office among a
number of His order, though the grammar returns
towards the end to One. The mention of Assyria
stamps this oracle also as of the eighth century. Mark
the refrain which opens and closes it.<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span></p>
<p>
<i>When Asshûr cometh into our land,</i><br />
<i>And when he marcheth on our borders,</i><a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a><br />
<i>Then shall we raise against him seven shepherds</i><br />
<i>And eight princes of men.</i><br />
<i>And they shall shepherd Asshûr with a sword,</i><br />
<i>And Nimrod's land with her own bare blades</i><br />
<i>And He shall deliver from Asshûr,</i><br />
<i>When he cometh into our land.</i><br />
<i>And marcheth upon our borders.</i><br />
</p>

<p>There follows an oracle in which there is no
evidence of Micah's hand or of his times; but if it
carries any proof of a date, it seems a late one.</p>

<p>
<i>And the remnant of Jacob shall be among many peoples</i><br />
<i>Like the dew from Jehovah,</i><br />
<i>Like showers upon grass,</i><br />
<i>Which wait not for a man,</i><br />
<i>Nor tarry for the children of men.</i><br />
<i>And the remnant of Jacob</i> (<i>among nations</i>,) <i>among many peoples,</i><br />
<i>Shall be like the lion among the beasts of the jungle,</i><br />
<i>Like a young lion among the sheepfolds,</i><br />
<i>Who, when he cometh by, treadeth and teareth,</i><br />
<i>And none may deliver.</i><br />
<i>Let thine hand be high on thine adversaries,</i><br />
<i>And all thine enemies be cut off!</i><br />
</p>

<p>Finally in this section we have an oracle full of
the notes we had from Micah in the first two chapters.
It explains itself. Compare Micah ii. and Isaiah ii.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>
<p>
<i>And it shall be in that day&mdash;'tis the oracle of Jehovah&mdash;</i><br />
<i>That I will cut off thy horses from the midst of thee,</i><br />
<i>And I will destroy thy chariots;</i><br />
<i>That I will cut off the cities of thy land,</i><br />
<i>And tear down all thy fortresses,</i><br />
<i>And I will cut off thine enchantments from thy hand,</i><br />
<i>And thou shall have no more soothsayers;</i><br />
<i>And I will cut off thine images and thy pillars from the midst of thee,</i><br />
<i>And thou shall not bow down any more to the work of thy hands;</i><br />
<i>And I will uproot thine Asheras from the midst of thee,</i><br />
<i>And will destroy thine idols.</i><br />
<i>So shall I do, in My wrath and Mine anger,</i><br />
<i>Vengeance to the nations, who have not known Me.</i><br />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

<h3><i>THE REASONABLENESS OF TRUE RELIGION</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Micah</span> vi. 1-8.</h5>


<p>We have now reached a passage from which all
obscurities of date and authorship<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> disappear
before the transparence and splendour of its contents.
"These few verses," says a great critic, "in which
Micah sets forth the true essence of religion, may raise
a well-founded title to be counted as the most important
in the prophetic literature. Like almost no others, they
afford us an insight into the innermost nature of the
religion of Israel, as delivered by the prophets."</p>

<p>Usually it is only the last of the verses upon which
the admiration of the reader is bestowed: <i>What doth
the Lord require of thee, O man, but to do justice and
love mercy and walk humbly with thy God?</i> But in truth
the rest of the passage differeth not in glory; the
wonder of it lies no more in its peroration than in its
argument as a whole.</p>

<p>The passage is cast in the same form as the opening
chapter of the book&mdash;that of an Argument or Debate
between the God of Israel and His people, upon the
great theatre of Nature. The heart must be dull that
does not leap to the Presences before which the trial
is enacted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>
<p>The prophet speaks:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>Hear ye now that which Jehovah is saying;</i><br />
<i>Arise, contend before the mountains,</i><br />
<i>And let the hills hear thy voice!</i><br />
<i>Hear, O mountains, the Lord's Argument,</i><br />
<i>And ye, the everlasting! foundations of earth!</i><br />
</p>

<p>This is not mere scenery. In all the moral questions
between God and man, the prophets feel that Nature
is involved. Either she is called as a witness to the
long history of their relations to each other, or as
sharing God's feeling of the intolerableness of the
evil which men have heaped upon her, or by her
droughts and floods and earthquakes as the executioner
of their doom. It is in the first of these capacities that
the prophet in this passage appeals to the mountains
and eternal foundations of earth. They are called, not
because they are the biggest of existences, but because
they are the most full of memories and associations with
both parties to the Trial.</p>

<p>The main idea of the passage, however, is the Trial
itself. We have seen more than once that the forms
of religion which the prophets had to combat were
those which expressed it mechanically in the form of
ritual and sacrifice, and those which expressed it in
mere enthusiasm and ecstasy. Between such extremes
the prophets insisted that religion was knowledge and
that it was conduct&mdash;rational intercourse and loving
duty between God and man. This is what they figure
in their favourite scene of a Debate which is now before
us.</p>

<p>
<i>Jehovah hath a Quarrel with His People,</i><br />
<i>And with Israel He cometh to argue.</i><br />
</p>

<p>To us, accustomed to communion with the Godhead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
as with a Father, this may seem formal and legal.
But if we so regard it we do it an injustice. The form
sprang by revolt against mechanical and sensational
ideas of religion. It emphasised religion as rational
and moral, and at once preserved the reasonableness
of God and the freedom of man. God spoke with the
people whom He had educated: He pled with them,
listened to their statements and questions, and produced
His own evidences and reasons. Religion, such a
passage as this asserts&mdash;religion is not a thing of
authority nor of ceremonial nor of mere feeling, but
of argument, reasonable presentation and debate.
Reason is not put out of court: man's freedom is
respected; and he is not taken by surprise through his
fears or his feelings. This sublime and generous conception
of religion, which we owe first of all to the
prophets in their contest with superstitious and slothful
theories of religion that unhappily survive among us,
was carried to its climax in the Old Testament by
another class of writers. We find it elaborated with
great power and beauty in the Books of Wisdom. In
these the Divine Reason has emerged from the legal
forms now before us, and has become the Associate
and Friend of Man. The Prologue to the Book of
Proverbs tells how Wisdom, fellow of God from the
foundation of the world, descends to dwell among men.
She comes forth into their streets and markets, she
argues and pleads there with an urgency which is equal
to the urgency of temptation itself. But it is not till
the earthly ministry of the Son of God, His arguments
with the doctors, His parables to the common people,
His gentle and prolonged education of His disciples,
that we see the reasonableness of religion in all its
strength and beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>In that free court of reason in which the prophets
saw God and man plead together, the subjects were
such as became them both. For God unfolds no
mysteries, and pleads no power, but the debate proceeds
upon the facts and evidences of life: the appearance
of Character in history; whether the past be
not full of the efforts of Love; whether God had not, as
human wilfulness permitted Him, achieved the liberation
and progress of His people.</p>

<p>God speaks:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>My people, what have I done unto thee?</i><br />
<i>And how have I wearied thee&mdash;answer Me?</i><br />
<i>For I brought thee up from the land of Mi&#7779;raim,</i><br />
<i>And from the house of slavery I redeemed thee.</i><br />
<i>I sent before thee Moses, Aharon and Miriam.</i><br />
<i>My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab counselled,</i><br />
<i>And how he was answered by Bala'am, Be'or's son&mdash;</i><br />
<i>So that thou mayest know the righteous deeds of Jehovah.</i><a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Always do the prophets go back to Egypt or the
wilderness. There God made the people, there He
redeemed them. In lawbook as in prophecy, it is the
fact of redemption which forms the main ground of
His appeal. Redeemed by Him, the people are not
their own, but His. Treated with that wonderful love
and patience, like patience and love they are called to
bestow upon the weak and miserable beneath them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a>
One of the greatest interpreters of the prophets to our
own age, Frederick Denison Maurice, has said upon
this passage: "We do not know God till we recognise
him as a Deliverer; we do not understand our own
work in the world till we believe we are sent into it
to carry out His designs for the deliverance of ourselves
and the race. The bondage I groan under is a bondage
of the will. God is emphatically the Redeemer of the
will. It is in that character He reveals Himself to us.
We could not think of God at all as the God, the living
God, if we did not regard Him as such a Redeemer.
But if of my will, then of all wills: sooner or later I
am convinced He will be manifested as the Restorer,
Regenerator&mdash;not of something else, but of this&mdash;of
the fallen spirit that is within us."</p>

<p>In most of the controversies which the prophets
open between God and man, the subject on the side
of the latter is his sin. But that is not so here. In
the controversy which opens the Book of Micah the
argument falls upon the transgressions of the people,
but here upon their sincere though mistaken methods
of approaching God. There God deals with dull consciences,
but here with darkened and imploring hearts.
In that case we had rebels forsaking the true God for
idols, but here are earnest seekers after God, who have
lost their way and are weary. Accordingly, as indignation
prevailed there, here prevails pity; and though
formally this be a controversy under the same legal form
as before, the passage breathes tenderness and gentleness
from first to last. By this as well as by the
recollections of the ancient history of Israel we are
reminded of the style of Hosea. But there is no
expostulation, as in his book, with the people's continued
devotion to ritual. All that is past, and a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
temper prevails. Israel have at last come to feel the
vanity of the exaggerated zeal with which Amos pictures
them exceeding the legal requirements of sacrifice;<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>
and with a despair, sufficiently evident in the superlatives
which they use, they confess the futility and
weariness of the whole system, even in the most lavish
and impossible forms of sacrifice. What then remains
for them to do? The prophet answers with the
beautiful words, that express an ideal of religion to
which no subsequent century has ever been able to add
either grandeur or tenderness.</p>

<p>The people speak:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>Wherewithal shall I come before Jehovah,</i><br />
<i>Shall I bow myself to God the Most High?</i><br />
<i>Shall I come before Him with burnt-offerings,</i><br />
<i>With calves of one year?</i><br />
<i>Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams,</i><br />
<i>With myriads of rivers of oil?</i><br />
<i>Shall I give my firstborn for a guilt-offering,</i><a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a><br />
<i>The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</i><br />
</p>

<p>The prophet answers:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>He hath shown thee, O man, what is good;</i><br />
<i>And what is the LORD seeking from thee,</i><br />
<i>But to do justice and love mercy,</i><br />
<i>And humbly</i><a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> <i>to walk with thy God?</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the greatest saying of the Old Testament;
and there is only one other in the New which excels
it:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</i><br />
<i>Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</i><br />
<i>For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.</i><br />

<h3><i>THE SIN OF THE SCANT MEASURE</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Micah</span> vi. 9-vii. 6.</h5>


<p>The state of the text of Micah vi. 9-vii. 6 is as
confused as the condition of society which it
describes: it is difficult to get reason, and impossible
to get rhyme, out of the separate clauses. We had
best give it as it stands, and afterwards state the
substance of its doctrine, which, in spite of the obscurity
of details, is, as so often happens in similar cases, perfectly
clear and forcible. The passage consists of two
portions, which may not originally have belonged to
each other, but which seem to reflect the same disorder
of civic life, with the judgment that impends upon
it.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> In the first of them, vi. 9-16, the prophet calls
for attention to the voice of God, which describes the
fraudulent life of Jerusalem, and the evils He is bringing
on her. In the second, vii. 1-6, Jerusalem bemoans her
corrupt society; but perhaps we hear her voice only
in ver. 1, and thereafter the prophet's.</p>

</p>

<p>Micah, though the prophet of the country and stern
critic of its life, characterised Jerusalem herself as the
centre of the nation's sins. He did not refer to idolatry
alone, but also to the irreligion of the politicians, and
the cruel injustice of the rich in the capital. The
poison which weakened the nation's blood had found
its entrance to their veins at the very heart. There
had the evil gathered which was shaking the state to
a rapid dissolution.</p>

<p>This section of the Book of Micah, whether it be by
that prophet or not, describes no features of Jerusalem's
life which were not present in the eighth century;
and it may be considered as the more detailed picture
of the evils he summarily denounced. It is one
of the most poignant criticisms of a commercial community
which have ever appeared in literature. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
equal relief we see the meanest instruments and the
most prominent agents of covetousness and cruelty&mdash;the
scant measure, the false weights, the unscrupulous
prince and the venal judge. And although there are
some sins denounced which are impossible in our
civilisation, yet falsehood, squalid fraud, pitilessness
of the everlasting struggle for life are exposed exactly
as we see them about us to-day. Through the
prophet's ancient and often obscure eloquence we feel
just those shocks and sharp edges which still break
everywhere through our Christian civilisation. Let
us remember, too, that the community addressed by
the prophet was, like our own, professedly religious.</p>

<p>The most widespread sin with which the prophet
charges Jerusalem in these days of her commercial
activity is falsehood: <i>Her inhabitants speak lies, and
their tongue is deceit in their mouth.</i> In Mr. Lecky's
<i>History of European Morals</i> we find the opinion that
"the one respect in which the growth of industrial life
has exercised a favourable influence on morals has
been in the promotion of truth." The tribute is just,
but there is another side to it. The exigencies of
commerce and industry are fatal to most of the conventional
pretences, insincerities and flatteries, which
tend to grow up in all kinds of society. In commercial
life, more perhaps than in any other, a man is taken, and
has to be taken, in his inherent worth. Business, the
life which is called <i>par excellence</i> Busy-ness, wears
off every mask, all false veneer and unction, and
leaves no time for the cant and parade which are so
prone to increase in all other professions. Moreover
the soul of commerce is credit. Men have to show
that they can be trusted before other men will traffic
with them, at least upon that large and lavish scale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
on which alone the great undertakings of commerce
can be conducted. When we look back upon the
history of trade and industry, and see how they have
created an atmosphere in which men must ultimately
seem what they really are; how they have of their
needs replaced the jealousies, subterfuges, intrigues,
which were once deemed indispensable to the relations
of men of different peoples, by large international
credit and trust; how they break through the false
conventions that divide class from class, we must
do homage to them, as among the greatest instruments
of the truth which maketh free.</p>

<p>But to all this there is another side. If commerce
has exploded so much conventional insincerity, it has
developed a species of the genus which is quite its
own. In our days nothing can lie like an advertisement.
The saying "the tricks of the trade" has
become proverbial. Every one knows that the awful
strain and harassing of commercial life is largely due
to the very amount of falseness that exists. The haste
to be rich, the pitiless rivalry and competition, have
developed a carelessness of the rights of others to the
truth from ourselves, with a capacity for subterfuge
and intrigue, which reminds one of nothing so much
as that state of barbarian war out of which it was the
ancient glory of commerce to have assisted mankind
to rise. Are the prophet's words about Jerusalem too
strong for large portions of our own commercial
communities? Men who know these best will not
say that they are. But let us cherish rather the
powers of commerce which make for truth. Let us
tell men who engage in trade that there are none
for whom it is more easy to be clean and straight;
that lies, whether of action or of speech, only increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
the mental expense and the moral strain of life;
and that the health, the capacity, the foresight, the
opportunities of a great merchant depend ultimately
on his resolve to be true and on the courage with which
he sticks to the truth.</p>

<p>One habit of falseness on which the prophet dwells
is the use of unjust scales and short measures. The
<i>stores</i> or fortunes of his day are <i>stores of wickedness</i>,
because they have been accumulated by the use of the
<i>lean ephah</i>, the <i>balances of wrong</i> and <i>the bag of false
weights</i>. These are evils more common in the East
than with us: modern government makes them almost
impossible. But, all the same, ours is the sin of the
scant measure, and the more so in proportion to the
greater speed and rivalry of our commercial life. The
prophet's name for it, <i>measure of leanness</i>, of <i>consumption</i>
or <i>shrinkage</i>, is a proper symbol of all those
duties and offices of man to man, the full and generous
discharge of which is diminished by the haste and the
grudge of a prevalent selfishness. The speed of
modern life tends to shorten the time expended on
every piece of work, and to turn it out untempered
and incomplete. The struggle for life in commerce,
the organised rivalry between labour and capital, not
only puts every man on his guard against giving any
other more than his due, but tempts him to use every
opportunity to scamp and curtail his own service and
output. You will hear men defend this parsimony as
if it were a law. They say that business is impossible
without the temper which they call "sharpness" or
the habit which they call "cutting it fine." But
such character and conduct are the very decay of
society. The shrinkage of the units must always
and everywhere mean the disintegration of the mass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
A society whose members strive to keep within their
duties is a society which cannot continue to cohere.
Selfishness may be firmness, but it is the firmness of
frost, the rigour of death. Only the unselfish excess
of duty, only the generous loyalty to others, give to
society the compactness and indissolubleness of life.
Who is responsible for the enmity of classes, and the
distrust which exists between capital and labour?
It is the workman whose one aim is to secure the
largest amount of wages for the smallest amount of
work, and who will, in his blind pursuit of that,
wreck the whole trade of a town or a district; it is
the employer who believes he has no duties to his
men beyond paying them for their work the least that
he can induce them to take; it is the customer who
only and ever looks to the cheapness of an article&mdash;procurer
in that prostitution of talent to the work of
scamping which is fast killing art, and joy and all
pity for the bodies and souls of our brothers. These
are the true anarchists and breakers-up of society.
On their methods social coherence and harmony are
impossible. Life itself is impossible. No organism
can thrive whose various limbs are ever shrinking in
upon themselves. There is no life except by living
to others.</p>

<p>But the prophet covers the whole evil when he says
that the <i>pious are perished out of the land</i>. <i>Pious</i> is a
translation of despair. The original means the man
distinguished by "&#7717;esedh," that word which we have on
several occasions translated <i>leal love</i>, because it implies
not only an affection but loyalty to a relation. And,
as the use of the word frequently reminds us, "&#7717;esedh"
is love and loyalty both to God and to our fellow-men.
We need not dissociate these: they are one. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
here it is the human direction in which the word
looks. It means a character which fulfils all the relations
of society with the fidelity, generosity and
grace, which are the proper affections of man to man.
Such a character, says the prophet, is perished from the
land. Every man now lives for himself, and as a
consequence preys upon his brother. <i>They all lie in
wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a
net.</i> This is not murder which the prophet describes:
it is the reckless, pitiless competition of the new
conditions of life developed in Judah by the long peace
and commerce of the eighth century. And he carries
this selfishness into a very striking figure in ver. 4:
<i>The best of them is as a thorn thicket, the most upright</i>
worse <i>than a prickly hedge</i>. He realises exactly what
we mean by sharpness and sharp-dealing: bristling
self-interest, all points; splendid in its own defence,
but barren of fruit, and without nest or covert for any
life.</p>

<h3><i>OUR MOTHER OF SORROWS</i></h3>

<h5><span class="smcap">Micah</span> vii. 7-20.</h5>


<p>After so stern a charge, so condign a sentence,
confession is natural, and, with prayer for forgiveness
and praise to the mercy of God, it fitly closes
the whole book. As we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> the passage is a
cento of several fragments, from periods far apart in the
history of Israel. One historical allusion suits best the
age of the Syrian wars; another can only refer to
the day of Jerusalem's ruin. In spirit and language
the Confessions resemble the prayers of the Exile. The
Doxology has echoes of several Scriptures.<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a></p>

<p>But from these fragments, it may be of many centuries,
there rises clear the One Essential Figure: Israel,
all her secular woes upon her; our Mother of Sorrows,
at whose knees we learned our first prayers of confession
and penitence. Other nations have been our
teachers in art and wisdom and government. But she
is our mistress in pain and in patience, teaching men
with what conscience they should bear the chastening
of the Almighty, with what hope and humility they
should wait for their God. Surely not less lovable,
but only more human, that her pale cheeks flush for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
a moment with the hate of the enemy and the assurance
of revenge. Her passion is soon gone, for she feels
her guilt to be greater; and, seeking forgiveness, her
last word is what man's must ever be, praise to the
grace and mercy of God.</p>

<p>Israel speaks:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>But I will look for the LORD,</i><br />
<i>I will wait for the God of my salvation:</i><br />
<i>My God will hear me!</i><br />
<i>Rejoice not, O mine enemy, at me:</i><br />
<i>If I be fallen, I rise;</i><br />
<i>If I sit in the darkness, the LORD is a light to me.</i><br />
<br />
<i>The anger of the LORD will I bear&mdash;</i><br />
<i>For I have sinned against Him&mdash;</i><br />
<i>Until that He take up my quarrel,</i><br />
<i>And execute my right.</i><br />
<i>He will carry me forth to the light;</i><br />
<i>I will look on His righteousness:</i><br />
<i>So shall mine enemy see, and shame cover her,</i><br />
<i>She that saith unto me, Where is Jehovah thy God?&mdash;</i><br />
<i>Mine eyes shall see her,</i><br />

<i>As in the days when Thou wentest forth from the land of Mi&#7779;raim, give us wonders to see!</i><br />
<i>Nations shall see and despair of all their might;</i><br />
<i>Their hands to their mouths shall they put,</i><br />
<i>Their ears shall be deafened.</i><br />
<i>They shall lick the dust like serpents;</i><br />
<i>Like worms of the ground from their fastnesses,</i><br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span></p>

<p>A Doxology:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<i>Who is a God like to Thee? Forgiving iniquity,</i><br />
<i>And passing by transgression, to the remnant of His heritage;</i><br />
<i>He keepeth not hold of His anger for ever,</i><br />
<i>But One who delighteth in mercy is He;</i><br />
<i>He will come back, He will pity us,</i><br />
<i>He will tread underfoot our iniquities&mdash;</i><br />
<i>Yea, Thou wilt cast to the depths of the sea every one of our sins.</i><br />
<i>Thou wilt show faithfulness to Jacob, leal love to Abraham,</i><br />
<i>As Thou hast sworn to our fathers from the days of yore.</i><br />

</p>
<p>
"No man, when in his senses, attains prophetic truth and inspiration;
but when he receives the inspired word either his intelligence
is enthralled by sleep, or he is demented by some distemper or
possession. And he who would understand what he remembers to
have been said, whether in dream or when he was awake, by the
prophetic and enthusiastic nature, or what he has seen, must recover
his senses; and then he will be able to explain rationally what all
such words and apparitions mean, and what indications they afford,
to this man or that, of past, present, or future, good and evil. But,
while he continues demented, he cannot judge of the visions which
he sees or the words which he utters; the ancient saying is very
true that 'only a man in his senses can act or judge about himself
and his own affairs.' And for this reason it is customary to appoint
diviners or interpreters as discerners of the oracles of the gods. Some
persons call them prophets; they do not know that they are only
repeaters of dark sayings and visions, and are not to be called
prophets at all, but only interpreters of prophecy."&mdash;Jowett's <i>Translation</i>.</p>

the parallel phrase <i>God of the armies of Israel</i>; 2 Sam. vi. 2, where it
is connected with Israel's battle emblem, the Ark (cf. Jer. xxii. 18);
and so throughout Samuel and Kings, and also Chronicles, the
Psalms, and most prophets. The plural &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; is never used in
the Old Testament except of human hosts, and generally of the
armies or hosts of Israel. The theory therefore which sees the
same meaning in the Divine title is probably the correct one. It was
first put forward by Herder (<i>Geist der Eb. Poesie</i>, ii. 84, 85), and after
some neglect it has been revived by Kautzsch (<i>Z. A. T. W.</i>, vi. ff.) and
Stade (<i>Gesch.</i>, i. 437, <i>n.</i> 3). The alternatives are that the hosts originally
meant those of heaven, either the angels (so, among others,
Ewald, <i>Hist.</i>, Eng. Ed., iii. 62) or the stars (so Delitzsch, Kuenen,
Baudissin, Cheyne, <i>Prophecies of Isaiah</i>, i. 11). In the former of these
two there is some force; but the reason given for the latter, that the
name came to the front in Israel when the people were being drawn
into connection with star-worshipping nations, especially Aram,
seems to me baseless. Israel had not been long in touch with Aram
in Saul's time, yet even then the name is accepted as if one of much
earlier origin. A clear account of the argument on the other side
to that taken in this note will be found in Smend, <i>Altiestamentliche
Religionsgeschichte</i>, pp. 185 ff.</p>

means exhaust the possibilities of suspicion&mdash;that the title has been
added by a scribe, who interpreted the forebodings of judgment
which Amos expresses in the terms of earthquake as if they were the
predictions of a real earthquake, and was anxious to show, by inserting
the title, how they were fulfilled in the great convulsion of
Uzziah's days. But to such a suspicion we have a complete answer.
No later scribe, who understood the book he was dealing with, would
have prefixed to it a title, with the motive just suspected, when in
chap. iv. he read that an earthquake had just taken place. The very
fact that such a title appears over a book, which speaks of the earthquake
as past, surely attests the <i>bona fides</i> of the title. With that
mention in chap. iv. of the earthquake as past, none would have
ventured to say that Amos began to prophesy before the earthquake
unless they had known this to be the case.</p>

suggests a nomadic origin, which agrees with the position of Tekoa
on the borders of the desert. Tekoa does not occur in the list of the
towns taken by Joshua. There are really no reasons for supposing
that some other Tekoa is meant. The two that have been alleged
are (1) that Amos exclusively refers to the Northern Kingdom, (2) that

above one thousand feet above the sea, while Tekoa is more than
twice as high as that. Cf. 1 Kings x. 27, <i>the sycomores that are
in the vale</i> or <i>valley land</i>, &#1506;&#1461;&#1502;&#1462;&#1511;; 1 Chron. xxvii. 28, <i>the sycomores that
are in the low plains</i>. "The sycamore grows in sand on the edge
of the desert as vigorously as in the midst of a well-watered country.
Its roots go deep in search of water, which infiltrates as far as the
gorges of the hills, and they absorb it freely even where drought
seems to reign supreme" (Maspero on the Egyptian sycomore;
<i>The Dawn of Civilization</i>, translated by McClure, p. 26). "Everywhere
on the confines of cultivated ground, and even at some
distance from the valley, are fine single sycamores flourishing as
though by miracle amid the sand.... They drink from water, which
has infiltrated from the Nile, and whose existence is nowise betrayed
upon the surface of the soil" (<i>ib.</i>, 121). Always and still reverenced
by Moslem and Christian.</p>

already seen. But we have been made aware, at the same time, that
Assyria's service to Israel in this respect presupposed the possession by the prophets of certain beliefs in the character and will of their
God, Jehovah. The prophets' faith could never have risen to the
magnitude of the new problems set to it by Assyria if there had
not been already inherent in it that belief in the sovereignty of a
Righteousness of which all things material were but the instruments.</p>

Hazael destroyed it, and that fact, taken in conjunction with its being
the only omission here from the five Philistine towns, is evidence
enough. In the passages quoted by Wellhausen there is nothing to
the contrary: vi. 2 implies that Gath has fallen; Micah i. 10 is the
repetition of an old proverb.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_266_266" id="Footnote_266_266"></a><a href="#FNanchor_266_266"><span class="label">[266]</span></a> The verb &#1506;&#1493;&#1511; of the Massoretic text is not found elsewhere, and
whether we retain it, or take it as a variant of, or mistake for, &#1510;&#1493;&#1511;, or
adopt some other reading, the whole phrase is more or less uncertain,
and the exact shade of meaning has to be guessed, though the
general sense remains pretty much the same. The following is a
complete note on the subject, with reasons for adopting the above
conclusion.
</p>
<p>
(1) LXX.: <i>Behold, I roll</i> (&#954;&#965;&#955;&#8055;&#969;) <i>under you as a waggon full of
straw is rolled</i>. A.V.: <i>I am pressed under you as a cart is pressed</i>.
Pusey: <i>I straiten myself under you, etc.</i> These versions take &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511; in
the sense of &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, <i>to press</i>, and &#1514;&#1495;&#1514; in its usual meaning of <i>beneath</i>;
and the result is conformable to the well-known figure of the Old
Testament by which God is said to be laden and weary with the
transgressions of His people. But this does not mean an actual
descent of judgment, and yet vv. 14-16 imply that such an intimation
has been made in ver. 13; and besides &#1496;&#1506;&#1497;&#1511; and &#1514;&#1506;&#1497;&#1511; are both
in the Hiphil, the active, <i>to press</i>, or causative, <i>make to press</i>.
(2) Accordingly some, adopting this sense of the verb, take &#1514;&#1495;&#1514; in
an unusual sense of <i>down upon</i>. Ewald: <i>I press down upon you
as a cart that is full of sheaves presseth</i>. Guthe (in Kautzsch's <i>Bibel</i>):
<i>Ich will euch quetschen</i>. Rev. Eng. Ver.: <i>I will press you in your place</i>.&mdash;But
&#1506;&#1493;&#1511; has been taken in other senses. (3) Hoffmann (<i>Z.A.T.W.</i>,
III. 100) renders it <i>groan</i> in conformity with Arab. 'î&#7731;. (4) Wetzstein
(<i>ibid.</i>, 278 ff.) quotes Arab. 'â&#7731;, to <i>stop</i>, <i>hinder</i>, and suggests <i>I will
bring to a stop</i>. (5) Buhl (12th Ed. of Gesenius' <i>Handwört</i>, sub &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;),
in view of possibility of &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492; being threshing-roller, recalls Arab. 'a&#7731;&#7731;, <i>to cut in pieces</i>. (6) Hitzig (<i>Exeg. Handbuch</i>) proposed to read &#1502;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;
and &#1514;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;: <i>I will make it shake under you, as the laden waggon shakes</i>
(the ground). So rather differently Wellhausen: <i>I will make the
ground quake under you, as a waggon quakes under its load of sheaves</i>.
</p>
<p>
I have only to add that, in the Alex. Cod. of LXX., which reads
&#954;&#969;&#955;&#8059;&#969; for &#954;&#965;&#955;&#8055;&#969;, we have an interesting analogy to Wetzstein's
proposal; and that in support of the rendering of Ewald, and its
unusual interpretation of &#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; which seems to me on the whole
the most probable, we may compare Job xxxvi. 16, &#1500;&#1488; &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1511; &#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;.
This, it is true, suggests rather the choking of a passage than the
crushing of the ground; but, by the way, that sense is even more
applicable to a harvest waggon laden with sheaves.</p>

suggests that Amos would have to go outside Palestine to see such a
waggon. That a people who already knew the use of chariots for
travelling (cf. Gen. xlvi. 5, JE) and waggons for agricultural purposes
(1 Sam. vi. 7 ff.) did not use them at least in the lowlands of
their country is extremely improbable. Cf. <i>Hist. Geog.</i>, Appendix on

couch:</i> or <i>Damascus-fashion on a couch</i>&mdash;alternatives all equally
probable and equally beyond proof. The text is very difficult, nor do
the versions give help. (1) The consonants of the word before <i>a couch</i>
spell <i>in Damascus</i>, and so the LXX. take it. This would be in exact
parallel to the <i>in Samaria</i> of the previous half of the clause. But
although Jeroboam II. is said to have recovered Damascus
(2 Kings xiv. 28), this is not necessarily the town itself, of whose
occupation by Israel we have no evidence, while Amos always
assumes it to be Aramean, and here he is addressing Israelites. Still
retaining the name of the city, we can take it with <i>couch</i> as parallel,
not to <i>in Samaria</i>, but to <i>on the side of a diwan</i>; in that case the
meaning may have been <i>a Damascus couch</i> (though as the two words
stand it is impossible to parse them, and Gen. xv. 2 cannot be quoted in
support of this, for it is too uncertain itself, being possibly a gloss,
though it is curious that as the two passages run the name Damascus
should be in the same strange grammatical conjunction in each), or
possibly <i>Damascus-fashion on a couch</i>, which (if the first half of the
clause, as some maintain, refers to some delicate or affected posture then
come into fashion) is the most probable rendering. (2) The Massoretes
have pointed, not <i>bedammeseq</i> = <i>in Damascus</i>, but <i>bedemesheq</i>, a
form not found elsewhere, which some (Ges., Hitz., Ew., Rev. Eng. Ver., etc.) take to mean some Damascene stuff (as perhaps our
Damask and the Arabic <i>dimshaq</i> originally meant, though this is not
certain), <i>e.g.</i> <i>silk</i> or <i>velvet</i> or <i>cushions</i>. (3) Others rearrange the text.
<i>E.g.</i> Hoffmann (<i>Z. A. T. W.</i>, III. 102) takes the whole clause away from
ver. 12 and attaches it to ver. 13, reading <i>O those who sit in Samaria
on the edge of the diwan, and in Damascus on a couch, hearken and
testify against the house of Jacob</i>. But, as Wellhausen points out, those
addressed in ver. 13 are the same as those addressed in ver. 9.
Wellhausen prefers to believe that after the words <i>children of Israel</i>,
which end a sentence, something has fallen out. The LXX. translator,
who makes several blunders in the course of this chapter, instead
of translating &#1506;&#1512;&#1513;&#1474; couch, the last word of the verse, merely
transliterates it into &#7985;&#949;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962;!!</p>

singled out as the place where the people put their false confidence,

give it as Kima, <i>i.e.</i> Pleiades. And this is the rendering of most
moderns. But Stern takes it for Sirius with its constellation of the
Great Dog, for the reason that this is the brightest of all stars, and
therefore a more suitable fellow for Orion than the dimmer Pleiades
can be. &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, the Fool or Giant, is the Hebrew name of &#8040;&#961;&#8055;&#969;&#957;, by which the LXX. render it. Targum &#1504;&#1497;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;. To the ancient world
the constellation looked like the figure of a giant fettered in heaven,
"a fool so far as he trusted in his bodily strength" (Dillmann). In
later times he was called Nimrod. His early setting came at the time
of the early rains. Cf. with the passage Job ix. 9 and xxxviii. 31.</p>

Eng. Ver. puts it in a form&mdash;<i>Have ye brought unto Me?</i> etc.&mdash;which
implies blame that they did not do so. Ewald was the first to
see that, as rendered above, an appeal to the forty years was the
real intention of the verse. So after him nearly all critics, also the
Revised Eng. Ver.: <i>Did ye bring unto Me?</i> On the whole question
of the possibility of such an appeal see above, pp. <a href="#Page_100">100</a> ff., and cf.
Jer. vii. 22, which distinctly declares that in the wilderness God
prescribed no ritual to Israel.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_320_320" id="Footnote_320_320"></a><a href="#FNanchor_320_320"><span class="label">[320]</span></a> Ver. 26 is very difficult, for both the text and the rendering of
all the possible alternatives of it are quite uncertain. (1) As to the
<i>text</i>, the present division into words must be correct; at least no
other is possible. But the present order of the words is obviously
wrong. For <i>your images</i> is evidently described by the relative clause
<i>which you have made</i>, and ought to stand next it. What then is to
be done with the two words that at present come between&mdash;<i>star of
your god</i>? Are they both a mere gloss, as Robertson Smith holds,
and therefore to be struck out? or should they precede the pair of
words, &#1499;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, which they now follow? This is the order of the
text which the LXX. translator had before him, only for &#1499;&#1493;&#1503; he misread
&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1508;&#1464;&#1503; or &#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1493;&#1464;&#1503;: &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#957;&#949;&#955;&#8049;&#946;&#949;&#964;&#949; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#8052;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#924;&#969;&#955;&#8056;&#967; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#8056; &#7940;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;

The Hebrew text would then run thus:&mdash;

<p class="righttxt">

<p>
(2) The translation of this text is equally difficult: not in the verb
&#1493;&#1504;&#1513;&#1488;&#1514;&#1501;, for both the grammar and the argument oblige us to take it
as future, <i>and ye shall lift up</i>; but in the two words &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1499;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;.
Are these common nouns, or proper names of deities in apposition to
<i>your king</i> and <i>your god</i>? The LXX. takes &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; as = <i>tabernacle</i>, and
&#1499;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; as a proper name (Theodotion takes both as proper names).
The Auth. Eng. Ver. follows the LXX. (except that it takes <i>king</i>
for the name <i>Moloch</i>). Schrader (<i>Stud. u. Krit.</i>, 1874, 324; <i>K.A.T.</i>,
442 f.) takes them as the consonants of Sakkut, a name of the Assyrian
god Adar, and of Kewan, the Assyrian name for the planet Saturn: <i>Ye
shall take up Sakkut your king and Kewan your star-god, your images
which</i>... Baethgen goes further and takes both the &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; of &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; and
the &#1510;&#1500;&#1501; of &#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; as Moloch and &#7778;elam, proper names, in combination
with Sakkut and Kewan (<i>Beitr. z. Sem. Rel.</i>, 239). Now it is true
that the Second Book of Kings implies that the worship of the host
of heaven existed in Samaria before its fall (2 Kings xvii. 16), but
the introduction into Samaria of Assyrian gods (among them Adar)
is placed by it after the fall (2 Kings xvii. 31), and besides, Amos
does not elsewhere speak of the worship of foreign gods, nor is the
mention of them in any way necessary to the argument here. On
the contrary, even if Amos were to mention the worship of idols by
Israel, would he have selected at this point the Assyrian ones? (See,
however, Tiele, <i>Revue de l'Histoire des Religions</i>, III., p. 211, who
makes Koun and the planet Keiwan purely Ph&#339;nician deities.)
Some critics take &#1505;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1499;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; as common nouns in the construct
state. So Ewald, and so most recently Robertson Smith (<i>O.T.J.C.</i>, 2):
<i>the shrine of your king and the stand of your images</i>. This is more in
harmony with the absence from the rest of Amos of any hint as to the
worship of idols, but an objection to it, and a very strong one, is that
the alleged common nouns are not found elsewhere in Hebrew. In
view of this conflicting evidence it is best therefore to leave the words
untranslated, as in the text above. It is just possible that they may
themselves be later insertions, for the verse would read very well
without them: <i>And ye shall lift up your king and your images which
you have made to yourselves</i>.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_321_321" id="Footnote_321_321"></a><a href="#FNanchor_321_321"><span class="label">[321]</span></a> The last clause is peculiar. Two clauses seem to have run into one&mdash;<i>saith Jehovah, God of Hosts</i>, and <i>God of Hosts is His Name</i>.
The word &#1513;&#1502;&#1493; = <i>His Name</i>, may have been added to give the oracle
the same conclusion as the oracle at the end of the preceding
chapter; and it is not to be overlooked that &#1513;&#1502;&#1493; at the end of a clause
does not occur elsewhere in the book outside the three questioned
Doxologies iv. 13, v. 8, ix. 6. Further, see below, pp. <a href="#Page_204">204</a> f.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_323_323" id="Footnote_323_323"></a><a href="#FNanchor_323_323"><span class="label">[323]</span></a> I remove ver. 2 to a note, not that I am certain that it is not
by Amos&mdash;who can be dogmatic on such a point?&mdash;but because the
text of it, the place which it occupies, and its relation to the facts
of current history, all raise doubts. Moreover it is easily detached
from the context, without disturbing the flow of the chapter, which
indeed runs more equably without it. The Massoretic text gives:
<i>Pass over to Calneh, and see; and go thence to Hamath Rabbah,
and come down to Gath of the Philistines: are they better than these
kingdoms, or is their territory larger than yours?</i> Presumably <i>these</i> <i>kingdoms</i> are Judah and Israel. But that can only mean that Israel
is the best of the peoples, a statement out of harmony with the irony
of ver. 1, and impossible in the mouth of Amos. Geiger, therefore,
proposes to read: "Are you better than these kingdoms&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> Calneh,
Hamath, Gath&mdash;or is your territory larger than theirs?" But
this is also unlikely, for Israel's territory was much larger than
Gath's. Besides, the question would have force only if Calneh,
Hamath and Gath had already fallen. Gath had, but it is at least
very questionable whether Hamath had. Therefore Schrader (<i>K.A.T.</i>,

understand Assyrian conquests, it is hardly possible to retain the
verses. Bickell's first argument against the verse, that it does not
fit into the metrical system of Amos vi. 1-7, is precarious; his second,
that it disturbs the grammar, which it makes to jump suddenly from
the third person in ver. 1 to the second in ver. 2, and back to the
third in ver. 3, is not worth anything, for such a jump occurs within
ver. 3 itself.</p>

Wellh. <i>in loco</i>, and König (<i>Einleitung</i>, p. 304, <i>d</i>), who reckon vv. 11
and 12 to be the insertion: the latter on the additional ground that
the formula of ver. 13, <i>in that day</i>, points back to ver. 9; but not to the
<i>Lo, days are coming</i> of ver. 11. But thus to miss out vv. 11 and 12
leaves us with greater difficulties than before. For without them
how are we to explain the <i>thirst</i> of ver. 13. It is left unintroduced;
there is no hint of a drought in 9 and 10. It seems to me then that,
since we must omit some verse, it ought to be ver. 13; and this the
rather that if omitted it is not missed. It is just the kind of general
statement that would be added by an unthinking scribe; and it does
not readily connect with ver. 14, while ver. 12 does do so. For why
should youths and maids be specially singled out as swearing by
Samaria, Dan and Beersheba? These were the oaths of the whole
people, to whom vv. 11 and 12 refer. I see a very clear case, therefore,
for omitting ver. 13.</p>

facts:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
The titles for the God of Israel used in the Book of Amos are
these: (1) <i>Thy God, O Israel</i>, <span dir="ltr">&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1498; &#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;</span>; (2) <i>Jehovah</i>, <span dir="ltr">&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span>; (3) <i>Lord Jehovah</i>, <span dir="ltr">&#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span>; (4) <i>Lord Jehovah of the Hosts</i>, <span dir="ltr">&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;</span>;
(5) <i>Jehovah God of Hosts</i> or <i>of the Hosts</i>, <span dir="ltr">&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;</span>
or &#1492;&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;.
</p>
<p>
Now in the First Section, chaps. i., ii., it is interesting that we
find none of the variations which are compounded with <i>Hosts</i>, &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;.
By itself &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (especially in the phrase <i>Thus saith Jehovah</i>, &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1499;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;)
is general; and once only (i. 8) is <i>Lord Jehovah</i> employed.
The phrase, <i>oracle of Jehovah</i>, &#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, is also rare; it occurs only
twice (ii. 11, 16), and then only in the passage dealing with Israel,
and not at all in the oracles against foreign nations.
</p>
<p>
In Sections II. and III. the simple &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is again most frequently
used. But we find also <i>Lord Jehovah</i>, &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (iii. 7, 8; iv. 2, 5;
v. 3, with &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; alone in the parallel ver. 4; vi. 8; vii. 1, 2, 4 <i>bis</i>,
5, 6; viii. 1, 3, 9, 11), used either indifferently with &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;; or in verses
where it seems more natural to emphasise the sovereignty of Jehovah
than His simple Name (as, <i>e.g.</i>, where <i>He swears</i>, iv. 2, vi. 8, yet when
the same phrase occurs in viii. 7 &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; alone is used); or in the solemn
Visions of the Third Section (but not in the Narrative); and sometimes
we find in the Visions <i>Lord</i>, &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, alone without &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (vii. 7, 8;
ix. 1). The titles containing &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; occur <i>nine</i>
times. Of these <i>five</i> are in passages which we have seen other
reasons to suppose are insertions: two of the Doxologies&mdash;iv. 13,
&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; and ix. 5, &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1492;&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (in addition the LXX.
read in ix. 6 &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;), and in v. 14, 15 (see p. <a href="#Page_168">168</a>) and 27 (see
p. <a href="#Page_172">172</a>), in all three &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;. The <i>four</i> genuine passages
are iii. 13, where we find &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1492;&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; preceded by &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;; v. 16,
where we have &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; followed by &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;; vi. 8, &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;,
and vi. 14, &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; &#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;. Throughout the last two
sections of the book &#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501; is used with all these forms of the Divine
title.</p>

of the genuineness of the verse do not seem to me to be conclusive.
He thinks the verse admissible because Judah had sinned less than
Israel; the threat in vv. 4-6 is limited to Israel; the phrase <i>Jehovah
their God</i> is so peculiar that it is difficult to assign it to a mere expander
of the text; and if it was a later hand that put in the verse,
why did he not alter the judgments against Judæa, which occur further
on in the book?</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_406_406" id="Footnote_406_406"></a><a href="#FNanchor_406_406"><span class="label">[406]</span></a> In determining the date of the Book of Hosea the title in chap. i. is
of no use to us: <i>The Word of Jehovah which was to Hosea ben Be'eri
in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and
in the days of Jeroboam ben Joash, king of Israel.</i> This title is trebly
suspicious. First: the given reigns of Judah and Israel do not
correspond; Jeroboam was dead before Uzziah. Second: there is
no proof either in the First or Second Section of the book that Hosea
prophesied after the reign of Jotham. Third: it is curious that in
the case of a prophet of Northern Israel kings of Judah should be
stated first, and four of them be given while only one king of his
own country is placed beside them. On these grounds critics are
probably correct who take the title as it stands to be the work of
some later Judæan scribe who sought to make it correspond to the
titles of the Books of Isaiah and Micah. He may have been the same
who added chap. i. 7. The original form of the title probably was
<i>The Word of God which was to Hosea son of Be'eri in the days of
Jeroboam ben Joash, king of Israel</i>, and designed only for the First
Section of the book, chaps, i.-iii.</p>

dynasties in Northern Israel from the beginning to the end of that
kingdom, more probably reflect the same ten years of special
anarchy and disorder after the death of Jeroboam II. See vii. 3 ff.;
viii. 4, where the illegitimate kingmaking is coupled with the idolatry
of the Northern Kingdom; xiii. 10, 11.</p>

take this to allude to a destruction of the Galilean Arbela, the modern
Irbid, by Salmanassar IV., who ascended the Assyrian throne in 727
and besieged Samaria in 724 ff. But since the construction of the
phrase leaves it doubtful whether the name Shalman is that or the
agent or object of the destruction, and whether, if the agent, he be
one of the Assyrian Salmanassars or a Moabite King Salman <i>c.</i> 730 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
it is impossible to make use of the verse in fixing the date of the

movement of his thoughts are far removed from the simplicity and
self-control which characterise the prophecy of Amos. Indignation
and sorrow, tenderness and severity, faith in the sovereignty of
Jehovah's love, and a despairing sense of Israel's infidelity are woven
together in a sequence which has no logical plan, but is determined
by the battle and alternate victory of contending emotions; and
the swift transitions, the fragmentary unbalanced utterance, the
half-developed allusions, that make his prophecy so difficult to the
commentator, express the agony of this inward conflict."</p>

&#1490;&#1502;&#1512; has been taken to mean "completion," and interpreted as various
derivatives of that root: Jerome, "the perfect one"; Raschi, "that

"consumptio," and so on. &#1491;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; has been traced to &#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;, Pl.

the woman at once with the idol-worship and a rich sweetness;
or to an Arabic root, &#1491;&#1489;&#1500;, to press, as if it referred either to the
plumpness of the body (cf. Ezek. xvi. 7; so Hitzig) or to the woman's
habits. But all these are far-fetched and vain. There is no reason
to suppose that either of the two names is symbolic. The alternative
(allowed by the language) naturally suggests itself that &#1491;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is the
name of Gomer's birthplace. But there is nothing to prove this.

imply not the blighting of crops before their season, but the carrying

Wünsche, p. 142), who instead of &#1493;&#1506;&#1502;&#1499;&#1499;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; proposes &#1493;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497; &#1499;&#1499;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;,
for the first word of which there is support in the LXX. &#8001; &#955;&#945;&#8057;&#962; &#956;&#959;&#965;.
The second word, &#1499;&#1502;&#1512;, is used for priest only in a bad sense by
Hosea himself, x. 5, and in 2 Kings xxiii. 5 of the calf-worship and
in Zech. i. 4 of the Baal priesthood. As Wellhausen remarks, this
emendation restores sense to a passage that had none before.
"Ver. 4 cannot be directed against the people, but must rather furnish
the connection for ver. 5, and effect the transference from the reproof
of the people (vv. 1-3) to the reproof of the priests (5 ff.)." The
letters &#1497;&#1499;&#1492;&#1503; which are left over in ver. 4 by the emendation are then
justly improved by Wellhausen (following Zunz) into the vocative
&#1492;&#1499;&#1492;&#1503; and taken with the following verse.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_500_500" id="Footnote_500_500"></a><a href="#FNanchor_500_500"><span class="label">[500]</span></a> The application seems to swerve here. <i>Thy children</i> would seem
to imply that, for this clause at least, the whole people, and not the

<p><a name="Footnote_508_508" id="Footnote_508_508"></a><a href="#FNanchor_508_508"><span class="label">[508]</span></a> The verse is very uncertain. LXX. read a different and a fuller
text from <i>Ephraim</i> in the previous verse to <i>harlotry</i> in this: "Ephraim
hath set up for himself stumbling-blocks and chosen Canaanites."
In the first of alternate readings of the latter half of the verse omit
&#1492;&#1489;&#1493; as probably a repetition of the end of the preceding word; the
second alternative is adapted from LXX., which for &#1502;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; must

used of Jehovah's majesty (Micah v. 3; Isa. ii. 10, 19, 21; xxiv. 14), and
(2) of the greatness of human powers (Zech. x. 11; Ezek. xxxii. 12).
In Psalm xlvii. 5 it is parallel to the land of Israel (cf. Nahum ii. 3).
(3) In a grosser sense the word is used of the rank vegetation of Jordan
(Eng. wrongly <i>swelling</i>) (Jer. xii. 5; Zech. xi. 3: cf. Job xxxviii. 11).
It would appear to be this grosser sense of <i>rankness</i>, <i>arrogance</i>, in
which Amos vi. 8 takes it as parallel to <i>the palaces of Israel</i> which
<i>Jehovah loathes and will destroy</i>. In Amos viii. 7 the phrase may be
used in scorn; yet some take it even there of God Himself (Buhl,
last ed. of Gesenius' <i>Lexicon</i>).
</p>
<p>
Now in Hosea it occurs twice in the phrase given above&mdash; &#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;
(v. 5, vii. 10). LXX., Targum and some Jewish
exegetes take &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; as a &#1500;&#1524;&#1493; verb, <i>to be humbled</i>, and this suits both
contexts. But the word &#1489;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; <i>to his face</i> almost compels us to take &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; as a &#1500;&#1524;&#1497; verb, <i>to witness against</i> (cf. Job xvi. 8; Jer. xiv. 7).
Hence Wellhausen renders "With his arrogance Israel witnesseth
against himself," and confirms the plaint of Jehovah&mdash;the arrogance
being the trust in the ritual and the feeling of no need to turn from
that and repent (cf. vii. 10). Orelli quotes Amos vi. 8 and
Nahum ii. 3, and says injustice cleaves to all Israel's splendour, so
it testifies against him.
</p>
<p>
But the context, which in both cases speaks of Israel's gradual
decay, demands rather the interpretation that Israel's material
grandeur shows unmistakable signs of breaking down. For the
ethical development of this interpretation, see below, pp. <a href="#Page_337">337</a> f.</p>

&#1495;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456; is more than once used of the mouth as a whole (Job viii. 7;

verse contain expressions which are unusual to Hosea, and a very
strange metaphor, but it is not connected either historically or
logically with the previous verse. The latter deals with the people
before God has scattered them&mdash;offers them one more chance before
exile comes on them. But in this verse they are already scattered,
and just about to be brought back. It is such a promise as both in
language and metaphor was common among the prophets of the
Exile. In the LXX. the verse is taken from chap. xi. and put
with chap. xii.</p>

chapter (<i>Z.A.T.W.</i>, 1893, pp. 281 ff.), claims to have proved that it contains
"eine wohlgegliederte Rede des Propheten" (p. 292). But he
reaches this conclusion only by several forced and precarious arguments.
Especially unsound do his pleas appear that in 8<i>b</i> &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1511; is
a play upon the root-meaning of &#1499;&#1504;&#1506;&#1503;, "lowly"; that &#1499;&#1504;&#1506;&#1503;, in

about Hosea's treble parallels), but the text is too obscure for translation.
The theory that it has been altered by a later Judæan writer
in favour of his own people is probably correct: the Authorised Version
translates in favour of Judah; so too Guthe in Kautzsch's
<i>Bibel</i>. But an adverse statement is required by the parallel clauses,
and the Hebrew text allows this: <i>Judah is still wayward with God,
and with the Holy One who is faithful</i>. So virtually Ewald, Hitzig,
Wünsche, Nowack and Cheyne. But Cornill and Wellhausen read the
second half of the clause as &#1506;&#1501;&#1470;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1510;&#1502;&#1491;, <i>profanes himself with

</p>
<p>
A. Taken as a threat 1. "It is I who redeemed you from the
grip of the grave, and who delivered you from death&mdash;but now I will
call up the words (<i>sic</i>) of death against you; for repentance is hid
from My eyes." So Raschi. 2. "I would have redeemed them from
the grip of Sheol, etc., if they had been wise, but being foolish I will
bring on them the plagues of death." So Kimchi, Eichhorn, Simson,
etc. 3 "Should I" or "shall I deliver them from the hand of Sheol, redeem them from death?" etc., as in the text above. So Wünsche,
Wellhausen, Guthe in Kautzsch's <i>Bibel.</i> etc.
</p>
<p>
B. Taken as a promise. "From the hand of Sheol I will deliver
them, from death redeem them," etc. So Umbreit, Ewald, Hitzig and
Authorised and Revised English Versions. In this case repentance
in the last clause must be taken as <i>resentment</i> (Ewald). But, as
Ewald sees, the whole verse must then be put in a parenthesis, as an
ejaculation of promise in the midst of a context that only threatens.
Some without change of word render: "I will be thy plagues, O
death? I will be thy sting, O hell." So the Authorised English
Version.</p>

my hands Professor Cheyne's "Introduction" to the new edition
of Robertson Smith's <i>The Prophets of Israel</i>, in which (p. xix.) he
reaches with regard to Hosea xiv. 2-10 conclusions entirely opposite
to those reached above. Professor Cheyne denies the passage to
Hosea on the grounds that it is akin in language and imagery and
ideas to writings of the age which begins with Jeremiah, and which
among other works includes the Song of Songs. But, as has been
shown above, the "language, imagery and ideas" are all akin to
what Professor Cheyne admits to be genuine prophecies of Hosea;
and the likeness to them of, <i>e.g.</i>, Jer. xxxi. 10-20 may be explained on
the same ground as so much else in Jeremiah, by the influence of
Hosea. The allusion in ver. 3 suits Hosea's own day more than
Jeremiah's. Nor can I understand what Professor Cheyne means by
this: "The spirituality of the tone of vers. 1-3 is indeed surprising
(contrast the picture in Hos. v. 6)." Spirituality surprising in the book that contains "I will have love and not sacrifice, and the knowledge
of God rather than burnt-offerings"! The verse, v. 6, he would
contrast with xiv. 1-3 is actually one in which Hosea says that when
they go "with flocks and herds" Israel shall not find God! He says
that "to understand Hosea aright we must omit it" (<i>i.e.</i> the whole
epilogue). But after the argument I have given above it will be plain
that if we "understand Hosea aright" we have every reason <i>not</i> "to
omit it." His last contention, that "to have added anything to the
stern warning in xiii. 16 would have robbed it of half its force," is
fully met by the considerations stated above on p. <a href="#Page_310">310</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_659_659" id="Footnote_659_659"></a><a href="#FNanchor_659_659"><span class="label">[659]</span></a> Ver. 8 obviously needs emendation. The Hebrew text contains
at least one questionable construction, and gives no sense: "They
that dwell in his shadow shall turn, and revive corn and flourish
like the vine, and his fame," etc. To cultivate corn and be themselves
like a vine is somewhat mixed. The LXX. reads: &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#8051;&#968;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#952;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#8017;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#963;&#954;&#8051;&#960;&#951;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;, &#950;&#8053;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#949;&#952;&#965;&#963;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#963;&#8055;&#964;&#8179;&#903;
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#958;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#7940;&#956;&#960;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#956;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#8057;&#963;&#965;&#957;&#951;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#8033;&#962; &#959;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#916;&#953;&#946;&#8049;&#957;&#959;&#965;. It removes
the grammatical difficulty from clause 1, which then reads &#1489;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465; &#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;;
the supplied <i>vau</i> may easily have dropped after the final <i>vau</i>
of the previous word. In the 2nd clause the LXX. takes &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493; as an
intransitive, which is better suited to the other verbs, and adds
&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#949;&#952;&#965;&#963;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;, &#1493;&#1512;&#1493;&#1497;&#1493; (a form that may have easily slipped from
the Hebrew text, through its likeness to the preceding &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;). <i>And
they shall be well-watered.</i> After this it is probable that &#1491;&#1490;&#1503; should
read &#1499;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1503;. In the 3rd clause the Hebrew text may stand. In the
4th &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; may not, as many propose, be taken for &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1501; and translated
<i>their perfume</i>; but the parallelism makes it now probable that we
have a verb here; and if &#1494;&#1499;&#1512; in the Hiph. has the sense <i>to make a
perfume</i> (cf. Isa. lxvi. 3), there is no reason against the Kal being
used in the intransitive sense here. In the LXX. for &#956;&#949;&#952;&#965;&#963;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;
Q<sup>a</sup> reads &#963;&#964;&#951;&#961;&#953;&#967;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;.</p>

without some hesitation" (<i>Prophets</i>, 413) is that which follows the
Hebrew text, reading in the first clause &#1500;&#1460;&#1497;, and not, like LXX., &#1500;&#1493;&#1465;,
and avoids the unusual figure of comparing Jehovah to a tree. But
it does not account for the singular emphasis laid in the second
clause on the first personal pronoun, and implies that God, whose
name has not for several verses been mentioned, is meant by the
mere personal suffix, "I will look to Him." Wellhausen suggests
changing the second clause to <i>I am his Anat and his Aschera</i>.</p>

the end of chap. i. refers to Sennacherib's campaign in Philistia in
701 (<i>A. T. Religionsgeschichte</i>, p. 225, <i>n.</i>). The former is possible,
but the latter passage, following so closely on i. 6, which implies the
fall of Samaria to be still recent, if not in actual course, is more suitably
placed in the time of the campaign of Sargon over pretty much
the same ground.</p>

is already devastated, reduced to the state of a shepherd's tower
in the wilderness. This, however, is incorrect. The verse implies
only that the whole country is overrun by the foe, Jerusalem alone
standing, with the flock of God in it, like a fortified fold (cf. Isaiah i.).</p>

properly reads Ephrath, giving its final letter to the next word

haud grandis est viculus."&mdash;Jerome, Preface to Micha. "Morasthi, unde
fuit Micheas propheta, est autem vicus contra orientem Eleutheropoleos."&mdash;<i>Onomasticon</i>,
which also gives "Maresa, in tribu Juda:
cuius nunc tantummodo sunt ruinæ in secundo lapide Eleutheropoleos."
See, too, the <i>Epitaphium S. Paulæ</i>: "Videam Morasthim
sepulchrum quondam Michææ, nunc ecclesiam, et ex latere derelinquam
Choræos, et Gitthæos et Maresam." The occurrence of a
place bearing the name Property-of-Gath so close to Beit-Jibrin
certainly strengthens the claims of the latter to be Gath. See

Jerusalem in the eighth century, and virtually implies her ruin and
desolation. But, on the contrary, it is not so: Jerusalem is still
standing, though alone (cf. the similar figure in Isa. i.). Consequently the contradiction which Wellhausen sees between this
eighth verse and vv. 9, 10, does not exist. He grants that the
latter may belong to the time of Sennacherib's invasion&mdash;unless it be
a <i>vaticinium post eventum</i>!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_900_900" id="Footnote_900_900"></a><a href="#FNanchor_900_900"><span class="label">[900]</span></a> See the passages on the subject in Professor Harper's work on

<p><a name="Footnote_903_903" id="Footnote_903_903"></a><a href="#FNanchor_903_903"><span class="label">[903]</span></a> This word &#1492;&#1510;&#1504;&#1506; is only once used again, in Prov. xi. 2, in
another grammatical form, where also it might mean <i>humbly</i>. But
the root-meaning is evidently <i>in secret</i>, or <i>secretly</i> (cf. the Aram.
&#1510;&#1504;&#1506;, to be hidden; &#1510;&#1504;&#1497;&#1506;, one who lives noiselessly, humble, pious;
in the feminine of a bride who is modest); and it is uncertain
whether we should not take that sense here.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_905_905" id="Footnote_905_905"></a><a href="#FNanchor_905_905"><span class="label">[905]</span></a> Probably a later parenthesis. The word &#1514;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492; is one which,
unusual in the prophets, the Wisdom literature has made its own
Prov. ii. 7, xviii. 1; Job v. 12, etc. For <i>Thy</i> LXX. read <i>His</i>.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_906_906" id="Footnote_906_906"></a><a href="#FNanchor_906_906"><span class="label">[906]</span></a> Translation of LXX. emended by Wellhausen so as to read
&#1502;&#1493;&#1506;&#1491; &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512;, the &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; being obtained by taking and transferring the &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;
of the next verse, and relieving that verse of an unusual formation,
viz. &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; before the interrogative &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;. But for an instance of &#1506;&#1493;&#1491;
preceding an interrogative see Gen. xix. 12.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_907_907" id="Footnote_907_907"></a><a href="#FNanchor_907_907"><span class="label">[907]</span></a> The text of the two preceding verses, which is acknowledged to
be corrupt, must be corrected by the undoubted 3rd feminine suffix
in this one&mdash;"<i>her</i> rich men." Throughout the reference must be to
the city. We ought therefore to change &#1492;&#1488;&#1494;&#1499;&#1492; of ver. 11 into &#1492;&#1514;&#1494;&#1499;&#1492;,
which agrees with the LXX. &#948;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#969;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;. Ver. 10 is more uncertain,
but for the same reason that "the city" is referred to throughout
vv. 9-12, it is possible that it is the nominative to &#1494;&#1506;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492;; translate
"cursed with the short measure." Again for &#1488;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; LXX. read
&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1462;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514; &#1488;&#1465;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;, to which also the city would be nominative. And this
suggests the query whether in the letters &#1492;&#1488;&#1513; &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;, that make little
sense as they stand in the Massoretic Text, there was not originally
another feminine participle. The recommendation of a transformation
of this kind is that it removes the abruptness of the appearance of
the 3rd feminine suffix in ver. 12.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_908_908" id="Footnote_908_908"></a><a href="#FNanchor_908_908"><span class="label">[908]</span></a> The word is found only here. The stem &#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473; is no doubt the
same as the Arabic verb wa&#7717;ash, which in Form V. means "Inami
ventre fuit præ fame; vacuum reliquit stomachum" (Freytag). In
modern colloquial Arabic wa&#7717;sha means a "longing for an absent
friend."</p>

and others infer; for it is to <i>the sword</i> they afterwards fall. They

LXX.), and by changing points, gets a reading which may be rendered:
<i>For evil are their hands! To do good the prince demandeth
a bribe, and the judge, for the reward of the great, speaketh what he
desireth. And they entangle the good more than thorns, and the
righteous more than a thorn hedge.</i></p>

the second personal pronouns to which this reply of the prophet is
addressed are all masculine. Notice the same change in vi. 9-16
(above p. <a href="#Page_427">427</a>).</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_919_919" id="Footnote_919_919"></a><a href="#FNanchor_919_919"><span class="label">[919]</span></a> &#1497;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511;&#1470;&#1495;&#1511;, Ewald: "distant the date." Notice the assonance. It
explains the use of the unusual word for <i>border</i>. LXX. <i>thy border</i>.
The LXX. also takes into ver. 11 (as above) the &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; of ver. 12.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_923_923" id="Footnote_923_923"></a><a href="#FNanchor_923_923"><span class="label">[923]</span></a> The words omitted above are literally <i>jungle in the midst of
gardenland</i> or <i>Carmel</i>. Plausible as it would be to take the proper
name Carmel here along with Bashan and Gilead (see <i>Hist. Geog.</i>, 338),
the connection prefers the common noun <i>garden</i> or <i>gardenland</i>:
translate "dwelling alone like a bit of jungle in the midst of cultivated
land." Perhaps the clause needs rearrangement: &#1497;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1514;&#1493;&#1499;&#1499;&#1512;&#1502;&#1500;, with
a verb to introduce it. Yet compare <span dir="ltr">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512; &#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;</span>, 2 Kings xix. 23;
